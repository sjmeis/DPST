FaithInStrangers94,33,Has anyone had any success in ameliorating ADHD symptoms with antidepressants?   Either prescribed for ADHD or for depression or anxiety and then noticed an improvement in ADHD symptoms?   I’ve been prescribed Zoloft predominately for anxiety but I’ve read reports of antidepressants like Wellbutrin helping with the emotional dysregulation issues.  Of course some reports of them making things worse as well.   Have any of you guys tried them?
FaithInStrangers94,33," The closest thing to an explanation is “what if they reply quickly and I get stuck in a conversation with them?” but they’re supposed to be a friend and also .. so what? just message them for a while?  In some cases someone will ask me when I’m free to meet up and I will leave them hanging for a month or more.   Someone who I actually would like to meet up with as well.   It’s so unexplainable even my psychiatrist wasn’t sure what the reasoning was.  Something about it just seems unduly mentally taxing. And after a few days go by I feel guilty and try to come up with an excuse to why it took me so goddamn long to reply, leading me to avoid it more.   Sometimes I’ll go on a spree and reply to everyone I’ve been ignoring then they’ll reply to me and the cycle repeats.  I’ve had some luck in forcing myself to open the messages and just start moving my finger tips without thinking about it - but it’s ridiculous that it’s come to this.   I have to address this because people these days don’t understand or tolerate it - I’ve lost job opportunities and dates and a few friends because of this. It’s the most damaging part of adhd for me by far."
MenuTime5231,32,"One self limiting belief I have is that for multitude of reasons that I cant leave my job with one of them being not wanting to just be remembered for my mental health struggles.   I came to terms with ADHD not just being ""Squirrel!"" Like people playfully describe it and it actually comes with things that make life more challenging since being here.    I've struggled in the open for a bit. If people at work had to describe me they would say ""Sweet, will do anything you ask of him, forgetful, gets grumpy, too hard on himself, a spaz, we have to watch how we speak to him, easily distracted.""   One passion of mine has been mental health. Now I don't know at this stage in my life if I truly want to work in mental health but I never feel I could tell my employer that I was leaving to work in mental health. The first thing everyone would say is ""How is he going to help somebody else, he can't keep his own shit straight""    I've been in therapy for over a year, I'm into my first week on meds, and find myself really thriving for a month at a time every 3 months. It feels like ""this time will be different"" and if I don't mess it up for myself something like a close death will throw me off track like it has now."

FaithInStrangers94,33,"I’ve tried everything.   No matter how tired I was throughout the day, by nightfall I’m wide awake and not only that but I’m interested by everything I see or hear.   I only had 45 minutes of sleep last night and was tired as hell all day planning to go to bed at 10pm to reset my sleep pattern.   Then just before I shut my laptop I see some article about films, end up watching Bladerunner 2049 then listening to standup from George Carlin, researching music and mood while listening to Ulcerates latest album and somehow ended up reading about Malthusian vs cornucopian futurism - whoops it’s 4am. The mf birds are chirping and the sun is started to raise its ugly head   Maybe I need to get a nocturnal job."

MenuTime5231,32,I have alot of interests but very little ever gets indulged. It's a constant mental battle of trying to enjoy things without thinking of all the things I'm sacrificing that may be more productive or fufilling. In a perfect world I wouldnt have a job and I'd spend all my time just enjoying all my interests but that takes money. In the end you add up the time and so much feels wasted
MenuTime5231,32,"I think all day of the things I want to do. The only problem is that I am at work during this time. I work until 7pm 5 days a week. I'm always considered ""on call"" . When I get home I think to myself ""I've worked all day it's time to kinda relax for a bit. I'll get to my hobbies in a few mins. It's 10pm at night.Am I really going to get out of bed and go work on a project? I didn't sleep much last night. It's been a long week. Why wouldn't I just start tomorrow? Even though I already know I have plans in the morning and plans for tommorow night.   What the heck do I do? I got to live my life at some point"
Terra246,30,"For reference I’m in America. I went to CVS and my adhd medicine, 10 mg of folcin ER for 30 days was $60 dollars while my other medications (not for adhd) were like $10-$20. I forgot how much I payed before for my adhd medicine but it wasn’t this much. Like is this normal for it to cost this much? If so that’s ridiculous, it’s ridiculous I have to pay at all for medicine that helps me function, but this is just, really bad."

FaithInStrangers94,33,So I never feel acutely bored like my little cousin does for instance since I can always entertain myself with my own thoughts for hours on end if need be. You could put me in a jail cell and I would find a way to entertain myself in my head.   Then every now and then I have the realisation that perhaps I’m always bored - which would explain my need to always be tapping my foot or thinking something wild or hyper fixating on something or other.   Or maybe I’m in a liminal space between extreme boredom and perseveration   All I know is that it’s a far cry from how regular people seem to define boredom
MenuTime5231,32,"This year will be the first year where I've asked for things like action figures and will actually get them.  Every other year I felt like I've had to ask for more ""adult"" things like vacuums, clothes, socks etc or otherwise someone will say ""You're in your 30s you're too old for this. Why don't you ask for things you really need""  Anyone else deal with this?"
MenuTime5231,32,"Thinking about this morning how I'm not really living my ""purpose"" or fufilled. I feel that's why so many small things occupy my mind because if I had something in my life that I lived slept and breathed I would never waste my brain power.   There always feels like a barrier. Either my environment, my finances, my wife, my job, etc. I feel I project the sense of importance of my passion onto things I'm not passionate about"
FaithInStrangers94,33,"I’ve grown to love my own company. That should be everyone’s goal right? Well I think I’ve actually gone too far - since my thoughts are so random I keep myself entertained and I obviously enjoy my own sense of humour and enjoy my interests - oftentimes I’d rather actually do things solo than with anybody else because when you involve somebody else you have to filter what you say and it feels less natural and more performative. Basically I find it a bit tiring being around people.  I had no trouble getting through lockdown while living by myself.   Meanwhile most people I ask tell me they can’t really stand being along with their thoughts.  I’m not sure if I’m the one with the problem or if they are, I suppose it depends which way you look at it.   Do you enjoy being alone?"
MenuTime5231,32,"I'd say the root of my issues stem from not having agency in my life. I've read Mark Manson's books, listen to Gary Vee, I've been in therapy, I do meditation but when it's just me alone in a room with just my thoughts I know that all the work that I do, at the end of the day I'm not really *happy* because I have no agency or control in my life. I'm for the most part ""Making the best of it""   It feels like there's always extra work to do just to get have a basic level of happiness that others experience. Is this job what I really want to do in life? No but my wife and I depend on the income and it's currently one of the best options for where I am. I have a mortgage so we can't just move to somewhere with better options, I'm married so theres more people that have to be on board. I have a lot of excuses so how can I expect to be better? Lol  I know I'm privileged that I haven't been homeless or anything like that. My life on paper right now is good. I should be able to go ""Boy STAHP  you is doing great"" but it's no fun feeling like you are working to build a life that in the end isn't even 100% of what you want."
MenuTime5231,32,"Unfortunately I didn't get any response on my last thread about being impulsive so trying again with less context.  I've noticed my impulsiveness has exploded lately and it's spread to different areas of my life. What are things you've done to manage?    If I write too much no one will respond, if I write too little my post gets removed. Just wanting to add just enough to get some help as it's the reason I made a post to start. Hopefully this can help meet the word count rules and I can learn more about being less impulsive with my emotions such as a desire to be drunk, telling jokes without reading the room, jumping to conclusions, etc. Thank you for reading"
MenuTime5231,32,"After losing a close family member recently I noticed that I drink a lot more than normal. Maybe not in quantity but definitely infrequency as I have drank at least 28 days out of the past 30 days. After a an embarrassing drunk night last weekend I decided that I shouldn't drink the next day. That was the first day in a month without drinking. I noticed the gravitational pull when I was around alcohol or anything related to alcohol that day. Last night was also a night that I did not drink but it was due to my wife giving me a judgmental look in the wine aisle  This has been concerning for me as I've never experienced this. But during meditation I noticed that that same impulsive feeling is the same feeling I have when it comes to going out to eat, or just about other activity that I enjoy. It is just so strong and since I'm not using fear as a means of self control anymore, I don't have a lot of reason to resist it.  Before his passing, I always had a story of how everything would go in my head. Most things I'd find a way to invoke panic and fear to keep me from doing things but I realized that thinking held me back from more things than I was trying to hide from. Now I feel like a science experiment observing myself without a ""leash""   As far as drinking goes and how I felt the same way when I wanted to go out for lunch yesterday, I managed not to do either. The feelings I felt were just the impulses of wanting it. I'm not craving the taste I'm craving the resulting feelings from partaking. I love how much I don't care when I'm drunk. I'm just carefree and the guy I am when drinking (personality, energy, fun, confident) is the guy I'm fantasizing about being when sober. Honestly after a year of therapy it's still challenging to be that way sober consistently. The way that I'm using alcohol isn't long term healthy and it's concerning to feel such a strong feeling around alcohol but I don't see myself in the same light as people I work with or family that have certified drinking problems. As much as my ADHD will make me impulsive, my ADHD also gives me things in phases. Just like anything in my life like hobbies or interests, sooner or later I'm just gonna wake up one day and not touch it again for months or years so I'm not really *worried* at this point"
FaithInStrangers94,33,"Can some folks really just start applying for jobs without weighing up all the hypothetical realities that could arise if they were successful, or walk over and talk to someone cute instead of overthinking what they should say and imagining different negative scenarios playing out, or open and assignment and start working on it without first assessing the state of their house and their life, or choose between two similar products at the supermarket without becoming overwhelmed and buying both, or live in the moment and make snap decisions without the tiresome old bastard in their head slowing them down?"

FaithInStrangers94,33,I’ve realised the only way is by brute forcing myself - if I waited for a natural inclination to start working on anything I would achieve absolutely nothing.   It often feels like I’m starting things prematurely or haphazardly but honestly that’s the only way I get anything done.  I write this as I realise I’ve just finished editing an essay in my underwear with one sock on and breakfast half made - I know if I waited for all the conditions to be right i wouldn’t even have started yet though.  Do you guys feel me?

MenuTime5231,32,I had a brain blast just now. I normally don't relate to people that have a hard time doing things like taking a shower or doing laundry or cleaning etc but as I do laundry myself for the first time in like months I thought about it.....what if my wife who normally cleans and does laundry (or at least more often) is really covering up parts of my ADHD? If I didn't have my wife I'd probably live in filth until it got on my nerves enough to have a hyperfocus run to clean it all up until it collapses again. Am I on to something?
SpektrumKid,2,"I have this pesky floater that's super close to my retina and bounces up and down, no matter what I look at. Basically everywhere I look, my attention is cut short from the motion that disturbs what I'm trying to see. My entire life has fallen apart, and it takes me months to clean, and I can't seem to ever catch up.  Does anyone else struggle with this? Would this make me a candidate to get surgery to get it fixed, or am I just being over sensitive?"
FaithInStrangers94,33,"She said she couldn’t stand the thought that she has the disorder and therefore doesn’t want to get diagnosed.  I told her its a physical ailment, and if you had a way of viewing chemical/neural activity you’d see it. You’d put a cast on a broken arm therefore you should take medication for a mental disorder, and actually that went a long way to helping her come to terms with it. Also this allows for more effective treatments.   By the end of the conversation she was expressing that she’ll go ahead and get diagnosed and not despair. So I consider that a win.  How did you respond to the diagnosis?"
MenuTime5231,32,"Im seeing my old negative habits coming back. I'm snapping at coworkers albeit they are deserving it's just that it's one those things I haven't had the same patience about. I'm negatively future projecting ""I just know that when I finally get a day off on friday this that I'll have to come in anyway and not really get a day off"" .  The work I'm doing is mediocre. I get tired of doing the same ole thing that isn't really doing anything but keeping us occupied.  My capacity for rude people, stupidity is zilch. I find myself talk negatively more like I was doing in my worse times.  I'm in therapy, I meditate daily, and recently experienced a tough loss so I know depression is seeping up. It's dangerous for me to stay in this place"

MenuTime5231,32,"Ive recently experienced a big loss in my life and my life feels like a a wrecking ball crashed through my nice fancy house I've worked on to build.

Terra246,30,"Hello I’m a 20 something year old male with adhd, GAD and depression. Both my therapist and psychiatrist told me they thought I could also have autism with my adhd. They didn’t explain the two the best, but both are very similar. I was wonder for those with both, what is that like? What’s the difference? What is it like to have both? What treatments are there for autism?"
Terra246,30,"I know that title sounds weird, but as someone with adhd, I feel like I am. When I say this, I mean in terms of the systems we live in. It’s harder to control impulse buying or play games with micro transactions because the temptation is real, and these systems were designed to exploit people. I know it’s not my fault, but I still don’t feel great about it, and I feel bad that others fall into these traps. School systems weren’t made for people with adhd, making it harder for us to get good grades, which then makes it harder to get good jobs and so on. Getting assessed is expensive, so is therapy and medication. I’m glad that things are getting better for those with adhd but I feel like the discussion of systematic changes to help those with adhd is rarely brought up."
MenuTime5231,32,"It feels so foreign to me to ""take time"" for myself or ""treat myself"". I spend a lot of time focused on others and taking care of others but as my wife said ""Who is going to take care of you?""  For me to take time to myself would be taking a month off of work and just coming back when I felt like I wanted to vs having to. That's not entirely feasible to do.   I feel my inability to understand how to truly take care of myself or take proper time for myself holds me back. As a husband and employee I feel I've given myself to a higher purpose than just my needs. I'd really like help figuring it out"

FaithInStrangers94,33,What are some jobs that require a thorough analysis of things (that aren’t economic/financial because I’m not a fan of those fields)   Or at least jobs where my natural predilection to analyse things won’t just be an issue as if has been with most previous jobs which are focused on executing rather than the analysing.   I’ve figured that I should try to make lemonade after squeezing these lemons in my eyes for long enough…   What do you guys think?
MenuTime5231,32,"I'm sitting here reflecting on a cold slow Saturday at work. I feel like there's so many things I could probably do with my time (mostly when it's too late to do them) But I have this feeling like life would be better if I had someone kind of directing traffic. I've come a long way over time but I still have these lingering things. I feel like I'm looking for my mother. Someone to say ""Do this"" ""Come on time to get up and get to it. We are leaving in 10 mins"" ""We are going to find another way"" ""You are going to this thing even if I have to carry you myself"" type thing.   Sure my wife can yell at me to get out of bed and get the house clean or take the garbage out but it registers more of overbearing. It is an intriguing feeling.   There's some learned helplessness in here as much of my life I felt incapable of doing things. I don't know exactly what taking care of myself means. A way I take care of myself is by taking care of others but as my wife says ""who is there to take care of you"" I feel this may describe executive disfunction as well. In any case, it bums me out that even death hasn't motivated me to really push myself to live with what I perceive as purpose. What exactly is it going to take to get my fire back? I don't feel a lot of motivation to do a lot and my thoughts seem like mental masturbation"

MenuTime5231,32,"It's been almost a month now and it feels like I'm supposed to be ""over it"" and ""can't use it as an excuse"" . I have more moments where the loss isn't at the front of my mind but I still feel like something's missing. My executive function has felt difficult to really do much of anything. I feel like I made promises that 3 weeks in I've yet to really fufill in a visibly significant way. Like a huge part of my life is gone and I STILL can't live like my life is finite? I don't know what ""taking care of myself"" means. I still have a job to do and they gave me leave when it happened. That was the time I'm expected to get it together but man I'm never getting over it. I don't want to forget them or let go of them.   I'm disappointed some of my old habits that my therapist and I have worked hard to overcome have started finding their ways back in. I'm not as focused on work but at the same time focused on the results of not being focused brings. I was living the best time of my life right before he passed and I hate that it feels like life is best when something bad is about to happen. It feels like some people life is one long stretch of happiness while mine feels like a lot of start and stops. I don't want people to die everytime I finally get to a place of happiness"

FaithInStrangers94,33,"That’s one of my biggest issues and the reason I don’t often enjoy socialising, because it can sometimes feel like I’m just playing a game of “don’t fuck up” which makes the whole thing feel pointless.  Most Other people seem to know where the boundary lies and can ride along it, while I end up transgressing it unintentionally so often.   When I try to let loose and go wild like others say at parties etc I tend to overstep the boundary and cause issues, so it leads me to be mild and cautious, but as I said that’s boring as fuck.  What do you guys do?"
FaithInStrangers94,33,"I’ve noticed that the more I want to do something the less likely I am to do it.  Say I really need to reply to an email, I’ll put it off for weeks even tho it takes 5 minutes.  Lately I’ve been telling myself fuck it, it’s not that important, I’ll just get it out off trrhe way now, and basically just go through the physical motions of something without making it seem bigger than it has to be.  When I just mindlessly/ half heartedly do things I can get through a lot, snd something is better than nothing.  Just dive into it: doesn’t need to be perfect"

MenuTime5231,32,"I have ADHD and one part of it is having a difficult time getting started. I'm putting this list out here in the hopes that the universe kind of shows me the way.  * I want to make a set of pro wrestling gear * I want to make a mock up of a video game using motion graphics *I want to finally get my idea for a positivity blog/vlog/podcast started *I want to make a 3d model that has a medium level of difficulty  *I want to find a side hustle where I'd make enough where I wouldn't feel like I HAD to stay at my current job for financial reasons  *I want to make a speciality cake from scratch.  *I want to follow through on art projects  *I want to test myself as an actor (currently just a guy that thinks he'd be good at it)  *I want to have a great idea for a script or book that I see all the way through and be something people want to read  * I want to be able to take my shirt off and people take notice in a positive way  *I want to test my skills as a wrestling manager, commentator, announcer, and show runner on a bigger platform than I am on currently to know if Ive really got a knack for it or just a big fish in a small pond.  *I want to put myself out there as a singer.

Terra246,30,"So I watched a video about highly sensitive people. As I always do, I think “a lot of that applies to me”. Looked it up and it seems to be common in people with adhd. I do wonder how common it is for people with adhd. When I say sensitive, I mean a couple of things. Feeling weird with loud noises and extreme stimuli. When I’m anxious or feel something physical, I feel it more and want it to be solved right away (example, it’s a bit colder now and I can’t stand it). Being an emotional sponge. Sometimes I’ll just look at a random person on the street and think “poor them, now I feel sad”. Being a people pleaser. Getting emotionally hurt over little things. Having emotions just going up and down. If this is common, what helps?"
FaithInStrangers94,33,"Tonight was going to be the night I reset my sleep pattern.  Somehow a quick Google search about earphones turned into hours of reading about the future of wearable technology which moved into tattoo ideas, giant extinct animals and concluded with 9/11 interviews.  Everything becomes a million times more interesting at night.   Now to try and get 3 hours before my busy as fuck day.  Of course if I mention this to anyone they’ll tell me just PUT YOuR PHOnE AWay etc   Oh well such is life with adhd"
Terra246,30,"So it feels hard to relax as someone with adhd. Everyone is going on about self care, and I think it’s good of course, I just wonder how one does it. I guess it can be small things but I’m pretty much off this week, and I love being off, but I’ll be alone, and gaming and videos aren’t enough self care for me. Was wondering if anybody had any suggestions for self care as someone with adhd that sadly cannot travel."
FaithInStrangers94,33,"I’m in a weird paradox where I’m probably more causal than the average person on a day to day basis but I never seem to get as rowdy as them at social events, and I think it’s because I’ve offended people in the past by saying whatever ridiculous shit comes to mind, so now I’m hyper aware of that and feel like I need to monitor myself even more when I’m in a party setting.  I see people dancing like maniacs, spilling their drinks and being loud and obnoxious but I feel like they ride the boundary of what’s acceptable, whereas if I didn’t keep myself in check I would go a step too far.  Maybe I’m being too harsh on myself?  What do you guys think?"
MenuTime5231,32,"Videogames, like books, have become an unintentional collector hobby. I have Red Dead 2, Last Of Us, Far Cry 6 , etc. I always talk about how I don't have the time to play video games. Last week I bought a baseball game and found a way to play it for hours on end for the past week. I got my team to the World Series and won. Now, who knows if I'll ever pick up that game ever again.  So my question is two fold. Why is it that I don't have time to play blockbuster releases, but found plenty of time to play a sports game from last year all week long? Also does anyone else relate to playing a game and once you beat it or a major part of it,  you just abandon it?  I am the same way with Mortal Kombat. I play the story mode and once I'm done I'm done.

Terra246,30,"Hello all I’m a 20 something male. I’m on 100 mg of prisiq, 60 mg of bruspar, 10 mg of focolin and 1 mg of clonzopam. The most recent addition was the focolin, abs it helps a lot more with my depression than the other medicines. I just notice a problem on it, a problem I’ve had for awhile, I’m irritable. By this I mean, it’s easy to make me upset or anxious. Sometimes I hyper focus on this to the point that I annoy people by saying “I’m sorry” too many times. I know adhd affects the mind and emotional regulation. I was wondering if there was any medicine that is common adjunct to adhd medicine, and if there are any behavioral things I can do to help this. To note, I am in therapy, I mediate, do yoga, exercise and practice mindfulness. Also when I bring this up to my doctor, he just wants me to wait for the pristiq to fully kick in, which it has at this point and I don’t feel that much if a difference. I felt a difference right away with the focolin. So yeah any adjunct medicine or things I can do to help with my emotions?"
Terra246,30,"Hello all, 20 something male here. Got adhd, anxiety and depression. I find it interesting how adhd interacts with depression. Needing that stimulation so that I’m not depressed, but sometimes getting anxious to do things, it’s a weird balance. Having too many choices or not enough, making me feel sad for some reason. Notice that being around friends helps a lot but can only do that for so long. On medication, focolin, pristiq, and bruspar. The focolin helps the most oddly but still don’t always feel the best. Also in therapy, think it helps but everything is so slow. Just wanted to see if anybody else feels like this and what helps them. I do mediation, yoga, and exercise, and I know about mindfulness."

FaithInStrangers94,33,"It’s been happening a bit lately; I’ll feel somewhat detached and in a lowered mood when I’m at a party or social event - then my mood will mostly pick up again when I head home or hang out with a close friend or two.   I’m not sure why exactly this is; maybe I expend too much energy trying to be socially appropriate and fit into the circular hole whilst being a square block, maybe it’s the sensory overload that eventually gets to me, maybe it’s my introverted tendencies. It doesn’t always happen but it happens enough to be noted.  As far as I know I don’t have social anxiety or ASD, it’s strange.   Anyone know what I mean ?"
Terra246,30,"So yeah, I start to do one thing and do not want to stop. Once I do that feeling of down comes up. I know it is because of adhd brain chemistry and dopamine. I’m just curious, how do people handle that low? Is it a medicine thing (on adhd medicine, antidepressant and anti anxiety). I feel like adhd meds contribute to this. Could he I have to do a specific thing? Thoughts or anything please leave them down below, really could use the help."
Terra246,30,"So honestly I’ve been playing a lot of smt 5. Love it, was just playing it and was grinding a lot, so much that I’m over leveled. Kinda came out of the hyperfixation on it for a second. God that feeling of going from a high high to a low low. Like smt 5 kinda keeps me going, sad to say. Just wondering if this is common? If so, what helps with the low lows?"
Terra246,30,"I just don’t know what to do. I’m a male in my 20s with adhd, depression, anxiety and will check to see if I’m bi polar, autism, and ptsd. I’ll be honest, I want answers to my problems. I just feel like even with medication and therapy, that I’m still just a slave to my emotions, a slave to my disorders. I know cbt blah blah blah, I’ve tried it, but these intense emotions still appear. I still have too many options and can’t choose something to do and when I do choose something, I want to do ten other things. Constantly going from one app on my phone to another, feeling anxious if I spend too much time on one. Hanging out with friends, constantly thinking “I only have this much time with them before I have to leave”. It’s so much. I exercise but even that I gotta convince myself to do. It’s so much and I just want help, but I’m afraid that this is it. That things won’t get better. It seems like browsing this sub, that things won’t get better, that I’m just stuck, and I should just be thankful that I’m this far. I dunno please someone prove me wrong."
MenuTime5231,32,"I'm somewhat hypocritical when it comes to maintaining friendships. I have standards that I'm not always meeting myself, I get that. The good thing(or bad depending on perspective) is that everyone is too.  For those who feel like they have a good grasp on maintaining friendships without detracting from your own life, what can you share with us to be better in our own situations?"
FaithInStrangers94,33,I’ve got such a tendency to say outrageous/offensive/bizarre stuff that I’ve resorted to viewing social interaction as more of a chance to fuck up tremendously rather than an opportunity to connect with people and form relationships etc   It’s a really pessimistic outlook but it’s not one that I can easily shake.   Any advice?
Terra246,30,"Hello I’m a 20 something male. I take 10 mg of focalin, 100 mg of pristiq, 1 mg of clonizapam, 60 mg of bruspar. Honestly the best thing for was focalin, helps out a decent bit. Before I was just depressed and anxious all day, so I’m glad I’m not there, but I’m not 100% either. Still feel a decent bit of anxiety or guilt in my upper stomach for parts of the day, every day. Then I may get really happy and excited. My mood bounces a lot now. My doctor wants me to wait for me to be on the pristiq for 8 weeks to get the full effect, I’ve been on it for 6 weeks. Honestly I didn’t think it did much to help, but now it’s hard for me to change task. Like I want to watch something on YouTube but I’m here on Reddit. Just wondering if there is anything besides adhd that people are given to help with emotional regulation and if the medicine helps. If not then any techniques that help (no cbt, I know enough about it)."
Terra246,30,"I just want to rent a cabin for a month and just chill out in nature. I want to go hiking and kayaking so badly. Want to see and take pictures of all sorts of animals around me. Maybe even have my own creepy crytid experience (joking, but would be fun). Something about the woods just feels like it’s calling to me, like Elsa in the beginning of frozen 2. Only problem is all my friends hate the woods. They prefer just staying in and doing nothing, which is fair but I don’t want to explore the woods on my own. Sometimes I do get obsessed with ah idea of a place to go or thing to do but no one else wants to do it, but I’ll answer the call of the wild one day."
AutoModerator,26,Got a good grade on a test? A new promotion at work? Finally finished a chore you've been putting off? We want to hear about it! Let us celebrate your successes with you!
FaithInStrangers94,33,"For example I’ll get my sleep pattern back in order and feel a lot better as a result and then almost defiantly I will just start staying up until 5am again. It’s the same with exercise, diet, meditation, reading, and any other routine.  It’s as though firstly it always takes effort and never becomes easier, and secondly part of me hates feeling imprisoned by a routine and would rather live in formless chaos.  Do you guys struggle here as well?"
Terra246,30,"So I’ve been learning that adhd affects my emotions, that I can feel really good and feel really bad. I’m on a lot of anti depressants and anti anxiety but it wasn’t until my small dose of focalin 10 mg that I started to feel better. Before I try anything else, my psychiatrist wants to me to wait for the full effects of the anti depressant pristiq 100 mg to take affect, 8 week, been on it for like 6 I think. Honestly I feel like that one doesn’t help too much. In therapy and trying to learn how to be emotionally resilient but I feel like I’m not doing the best. I still feel this feeling of regret or anxiety in my stomach for most of the day, not as strong as before but still there. Tried cbt in the past, still do but the feeling stays. I exercise regularly. Just wondering how others with adhd deal with their negative emotions. Is it more of a medicine thing like having mood stabilizers or more adhd medicine or is it more of a mental thing? Maybe a type of therapy that helps those with adhd more than cbt, doing dbt and emdr. Any help would be appreciated, thank you."
FaithInStrangers94,33,"To abruptly walk out of the job, call off the relationship, quit talking to a friend, basically just peace out.  It’s not something I’m proud of but I feel claustrophobic VERY easily and am inclined to just throwing myself overboard when I sense that there’s a possibility of a fire about the ship. My stress tolerance is really damn low.   Ironically this ultimately backfires and I struggle to make progress with my career or relationships and end up mad at myself.   But do you guys feel me here?"
Terra246,30,"Was playing a game with friends and I’m not sure if they were being honest or not, but I was loosing and they said it’s because I suck at the game. For some reason I got really angry about this. Felt like I was being ganged up on. Is this normal for those with adhd? I feel so bad I yelled at them a bit and said they were assholes."
Terra246,30,"So I’m gonna be 25 soon, quarter life crisis time! Yeah I’m not sure what my true passion lies if I’m being honest. Working as a therapist is alright, but eh. Could be better. My off time is mostly games, YouTube, anime and being on here. I guess besides getting an apartment with a friend, I don’t have that much in terms of achievable life goals, or I don’t feel the motivation. Would love to have enough money to always be finically stable, but that’s not gonna happen anytime soon. Would love to travel the world with friends, more obtainable but not anytime soon (covid). Going camping or being around nature a lot is another one, none of my friends want to and I don’t want to do it alone. Besides that, I just really don’t know what I want from life, and that kinda bums me out. I feel like adhd affects this, therefore why I’m here. Anyone feel the same? Anyone got any useful advice (medicated, therapy, exercise, and yes even mindfulness)?"
Terra246,30,"I’ll start this by saying I’m on medication for adhd, anxiety and depression. I do exercise, checked my victim D levels, do mindfulness, see a therapist and all that. Just had time to reflect on my life with adhd and I start to notice something. I know that all or nothing thinking isn’t good, but my a lot of times it feels like I’m either very happy or very sad. My mood can change throughout the day rapidly, even worse with day light savings time. It’s weird going from being anxious and sad to feeling like the king of the world. My mom has screamed at me that life isn’t just fun, but when I rarely feel just in the middle, I’d rather choose the good feeling. I know that mood swings are common in those with adhd, but I wonder if anyone else feels this way, that there isn’t much middle ground, it’s either one extreme or the other. Could also be undiagnosed bi polar mixed in with adhd, getting that checked out in December. But yes, is it normal to have these highs and lows with adhd? If so what has helped you when you get in the low?"

FaithInStrangers94,33,"Whilst I hate formalities and rules, I’ve noticed an interesting phenomenon in myself wherein I sometimes actually feel a bit more comfortable in formal settings, as opposed to say a party or club where it feels like anything goes (yet in reality that’s not the case).   Maybe this is a defence mechanism because I have a history of overstepping boundaries and saying offensive stuff without intending to?  Can any of you guys relate to this?"
Terra246,30,"Hello, still new to figuring out stuff about adhd. I’ve had my adhd diagnosis for awhile, but only now as an adult, reflecting back on things that I’m starting to see how adhd affected me growing up. I’ve noticed that I have pretty bad mood swings. Feeling like a roaring lion one moment to being sad ir bored the next. I notice I feel really good at night right before I go to bed I want to do a lot of things, fall asleep and don’t completely retain that energy. This could also be from my depression which has gotten better but it’s still difficult to get out of bed. I’m on anti anxiety and anti depressants and I take my adhd medicine and these mood swings still happen. Heck I decided to get re assessed just to make sure I don’t have bi polar or specific anxiety disorders also. Just wondering if these mood swings are normal for those with adhd, and how they overcame it. Does mood stabilizers help out? And yes I work out, mediate, and practice mindfulness."
Terra246,30,"I’m not sure if this is common in people with adhd or not. I invited my friend over and I know he can be really slow getting here, but it always makes me angry when he shows up late and we don’t have that much time to do stuff. Like my energy goes from “heck yeah” to “I’m angry” pretty quickly when this happens. I guess I get this idea of what the day will be like in my head and then bam it doesn’t happen. Dad tells me I gotta be more adaptable but that’s hard for my brain."
FaithInStrangers94,33,"As though they don’t like your company, they’re merely forced to tolerate it.   My mind works in such tangents that I often bewilder and exhaust whoever I’m speaking with - especially if they’re a neuro typical who is used to having conversations with a logical flow.   Most the time I feel like I’m speaking at someone, genuinely forgetting to ask them questions, drivelling on about shit they’re not remotely interested in - that’s probably true to some level - but I definitely think I’m being too harsh on myself as well.  When I’m chatting with someone who also thinks in unrelated tangents like I do we often have an electrifying conversation like a rollercoaster, but to the average person I think I come across a little bit demented.  I know it seems too self defeating and paranoid but does anyone relate?"
Terra246,30,"This is something I’ve thought about for a bit. For context I’m 20 something male with adhd, GAD, and depression. Been getting help which has helped, but there is still something I can’t shake off. It still feels like my emotions are not in my control. Even now that I’m safe and alright, nothing bad is happening to me, I still feel something, I think it’s sadness, regret maybe. Always feel it in my upper stomach. I’m on medicine for it and weirdly enough the adhd medicine has done the most to help it, more so changing it to excitement, but I still feel it a bit. Some therapist I see tell me to do CBT, but I feel like that doesn’t help. I acknowledge the feeling is happening, but it just sticks around. I try not to judge it but it doesn’t go away so eventually I get anxious or angry that it’s still there. My pain threshold isn’t high so any minor annoyanice physically I don’t like, why I can’t stand being sick. I excercise and mediate but that feeling is still there. It goes away at certain points, normally at night. It’s made me wonder if I also have bi polar or something else. Can anyone give me some advice or support? I’m trying really hard to overcome this but it likes to stick around."
Terra246,30,"Hello I’m a 20 something year old male with adhd, been diagnosed for a long time. I’ve been doing some self reflection and when people say “dream job” I can’t think of one. The idea of work kinda makes me anxious, and I don’t really dream of larbor. Normally I want to watch things, play games and hang out with friends. I cannot do all these things all the time, and I get anxious sometimes doing them, thinking “I only have this much time left with my friends”. I would want to try new hobbies and meet new people but well covid is a thing and I get anxious about doing new things normally. I don’t like feeling trapped in doing something. Kinda leads to me being bored because I didn’t go out, but I was too anxious to go. I was just wondering if this is a shared experience or if this is more of me thing, and if anybody has any advice or help (on medications, I exercise and yes I know about mindfulness)."
Terra246,30,"I know that sounds odd, but like I’ve started to notice that when I cry, I just keep on crying. I start to hyper focus on what I’m crying about and I keep feeling not great for awhile. Most say crying feels relieving, and it kinda is but not as much with. Not sure if is an ADHD thing or a me thing. Anybody else have this or something similar?"
Terra246,30,"I was starting to feel confident again. I start taking my adhd medicine again and that seemed to help with my anxiety and depression. I was good for a two weeks. Then my boss told me I wasn’t doing well at my job. Just a bit of criticism set me back to crying. To feeling bad about myself. I’m back where I was before, and I don’t like being here. I can’t stop crying. I’ve been trying to be good at my job, but doing through depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and adhd mass it so hard. It just feels like everyone has a certain limit that they can deal with me before they say something that hurts. Before they say how much of a burden I am. When before they acknowledged how hard it is for me, said they were proud of me. Always feels like they are lying, and when they yell and get angry, that’s the real them. That I am just a burden, that I shouldn’t feel this way. That I shouldn’t let adhd define me. I felt like I was getting closer, but now I’m tumbling back down. Once I start crying, it’s so hard to stop. I can’t get these ideas out of my head. I just feel so bad for being a burden to everyone around me, I thought I was getting better, but I panicked, so I’ve failed. I’m sorry I’m normal, I wish I didn’t have adhd, depression, anxiety and panic attacks."

FaithInStrangers94,33,"It seems like most other people can ride these boundaries without crossing them.    Meanwhile I’ll often cross them without realising it and unintentionally offend or unsettle people with my unorthodox questions and tangent and stuff. Sometimes just a random comment I blurt out that’s pretty hurtful and difficult to retract.  To counter this I sometimes put a filter on my mouth that’s so restrictive it makes me boring and it drains the fun out of socialising completely.  Maybe it’s not that I don’t understand boundaries but I cross them unintentionally way too often.  I know guys who I’d say are very questionable in their morals, yet who know how to ride the boundaries somehow meanwhile I like to think of myself as a good person but I often get misinterpreted otherwise.   It’s lost me someone who I was seeing and got me fired once, and got me into some tight situations with people.  Wtf is the solution?"
SpektrumKid,2,"I honestly can't handle texting anymore. The constant ongoing conversations of multiple people that never seem to fully end. It's slowly driving me nuts, and I honestly have started blocking most people most of the time. Not out of spite, but because I can't handle what a text I don't see until I wake up will do to my day.  So to spare myself, and stay somewhat function (notification muting isn't enough), I've resorted to blocking most people and unblocking them when I feel I have enough resources to start a conversation.   But isn't there a way I can only block people from texting?   I really don't mind phone calls as long as I'm not obligated to call people back at any specific time. I have a pretty ok time with seeing I missed a call from a friend a week ago, and then call him back as soon as I feel like talking.  But the 'urgency' that seems built into text messages, I really don't have room for in my life anymore.  Can I get a phone that I can turn texts off completely in? Or can I somehow get a cell phone number that you can only call? Must I really resort to getting a landline phone? I guess that's the next natural step for me?"
FaithInStrangers94,33,"Man I just peaced out after like half an hour @ my best friends bday @ an overcrowded club downtown.   It’s nothing new from me but I really though tonight was gonna be a good night, yet as soon as I stepped foot inside and was overwhelmed by the music, flashing lights, sweaty people shouting in my ear… I was like nah absolutely fuck this and started planning my getaway.   I know this isn’t a straight up adhd thing but I know it’s APD affects a lot of us and we got a tendency to get overwhelmed.   Anyone relate?"

FaithInStrangers94,33,"I read posts here about people having emotional breakdowns when they’re off their medication and I can’t relate at all.  Yeah my mood can swing and I can get mad at myself for being unproductive and absent minded when I’m unmedicated but stimulant medication puts me on an even more intense rollercoaster - for the first hour I feel great almost a bit euphoric, then steady focus for a few hours, then irritable and lethargic during the comedown, then finally back to baseline albeit a bit exhausted   I’ve tried almost every form of medication and some are better than others but they all mess around my mood a bit.  I don’t see how it’s possible that these could help regulate your emotions, since they’re not constant like SSRIs and one can notice them kicking in and wearing off"
FaithInStrangers94,33,"I feel mentally lethargic, foggy and slightly unsettled. My ADHD gets slightly worse in other words.   It’s the precise opposite to how most people report feeling after exercise   Therefore my only real motivation for exercising is to maintain my physique since I’ve worked quite hard for it and a vague sense of pride from being self disciplined - I’ve never experienced any noticeable mental benefits though.  How do you feel?"
Terra246,30,"I had this thought and I wasn’t sure if it was adhd related or not. For context I’m a m 20s diagnosed with adhd at a young age, also have GAD and depression. Recently got out of a depressive state with the help of ADHD medicine. I oddly feel more adhd though. That is better than the depressive state I was in, but I do feel like the anxiety is more noticeable. I think that anxiety kinda comes from, feeling like there is something missing, I’m not sure how else to describe it. I can have fun, and do nice things, but there is still this emptiness or clawing, like something is wrong. I apologize for not being able to word it better, but that is how it feels. Will say I do excercise, on anti depressants and anti anxiety, in therapy, but I have a lot of free time on my hands and not much to do. Does anyone else experience this? If so, does anything help them? Any comment is appreciated, and I look forward to talking to you all in the comments, thank you."
Terra246,30,"I have developed a technique for not being bored of things. It’s a technique I taught myself from a young age, not knowing that adhd made it harder to enjoy things for awhile. I would only really play games, and once I started to have more than one game, I would cycle them out once one game hit boring. Then when I haven’t played a game in a bit, it sometimes became fun again. I do feel bad for constantly seeking stimulation, my mom has yelled at me saying “life isn’t just fun and games”. I was just wondering if there was a better way to keep my interest fresh. I should have more hobbies, open to suggestions and yes I work out. Thank you all."
SpektrumKid,2,"For my own sanity I've found it incredible useful to just block off people from being able to text me, because mentally I can't put unanswered texts aside in my head, and since I can't do the sorting automatically, it's easier for me to just shield off my phone from incoming messages.  But is there a way I can do this automatically? Can I make a script on my computer that opens and closes incoming texts?  I know I can mute texts, but as soon as I \*see\* a text my mind is already preoccupied with trying to figure out how to answer, so it's simply a way for me to avoid that headache of \*knowing\*.  Is this possible with any texting/messaging service?"
FaithInStrangers94,33,"Even when I’ve tried to reset my sleep pattern I seem to feel sluggish and torpid in the mornings and midday, then gradually grow more creative and engaged through the afternoon until it’s 4am and I’m smashing out my best work.  This seems to be a common thread.  I don’t even have insomnia, I could sleep if I forced myself to sleep if I needed to, but I feel compelled to stay up, everything becomes more interesting and I can focus far easier.  What’s it like for you?"
Terra246,30,"Hello I’m a 20 something male. I’ve been diagnosed for awhile but only recently got back on my medicine for adhd paired with anti depressants and anti anxiety meds. The adhd medicine honestly helped me get out of a pit of depression that I was in for awhile. I’m starting to feel I guess normal is the best word for it, but I’m remembering issues I had and still do have now that I’m in a better mental space. One issue that I remember is keeping my excitement in check. I’ve noticed throughout my life I would hyper focus on one thing that would be happening soon and that’s what occupied my thoughts, growing up it mostly games or vacations, still is (currently SMT V is on the brain). The problem then becomes overhyping something, romantizing it, and then I get it and it’s fun for awhile or not what I expected, then what? Honestly I kinda fall back into a depressive state in the past, like I remeber not wanting to finish the last hunger games book in highschool because that is what was fun for me, and when I did, I had nothing so I was depressed. Before anyone says it, yes I mediate and yes I excercise. I’m curious if this is a me thing, or if it’s common? Does anyone know of ways to combat this cycle? Random but any good adhd you tubers that one could recommend would be nice also. Also you can just message me if you wanna talk that way. This was a long one out thanks to everyone who read it and commented."

Terra246,30,"I honestly wanted to vent about something I’ve been noticed more and more. I will preface this by saying I am glad there are more resources for children with adhd now then there was when I was growing up (I’m in my 20s), and getting children help with adhd is very important. I just get annoyed that from my experience, it stops at childhood, maybe adolescents. I think there is a stigma that ADHD is a children’s disorder which isn’t true, and makes it harder for adults with adhd to get help. I remember going to one therapist who specialized in adhd, but she had only really worked with children. So getting help is harder for adhd is harder as an adult. You may get a therapist that is biased and has no idea what adhd is (that’s a mark of a bad therapist but that’s a different discussion). Trying to look up resources online for adhd help, most if not all of it is aimed at children. Heck I honestly was looking up the best places for those with adhd to live, and all o could find was of course, best places to raise child with adhd. Like am I the only one experiencing this? Is there any good resources for adults with adhd?"

MenuTime5231,32,"This is more or less just something intended to brighten your day by making light out of how my brain typically flows. I remember the times it would make me feel so stupid but now it's just kind of humorous and honestly I find it to be somewhat of an attractive quality about myself. It's something that I think when I have a more active group of friends that it's a quirk that they smile and shake their heads and go ""That's our guy""   I say all this to say, be nicer to yourself. Sometimes we need a foot in our ass to push us further down the field but there's a time and place and even a better way to do it than you are now."
FaithInStrangers94,33,"The ones that cause you to stop and think “what the fuck was I saying again?” Or cause your brain just to freeze when someone asks you a simple question.  Maybe that’s more of an anxiety related issue? I feel like it hits a lot of us with adhd though.  I don’t know if it’s a lack of thought or actually that you’re being bombarded by so many thoughts they’re almost cancelling each other out. Whatever, it’s frustrating.   Obviously medication can help but what else?"
Terra246,30,"Hello I’m a 20 something male here. Recently I had been suffering from depression and anxiety for a couple of months. I also have adhd, but my psychiatrist wanted to treat the depression and anxiety first. Eventually I convinced him to put me on focolin (can’t spell sorry). He said that even with clients with adhd he gives them focolin as an adjunct to depression medicine. I just started today, but I feel a difference. It can still be hard for me to do one thing, pick a video to watch and all that, but I don’t feel the negative feelings that I had before. I feel oddly a bit my energies, confident, happy, like I want to do things. People say medicine isn’t magic and I’m of course gonna continue with therapy and other stuff, but like wow. Anyone else have this experience?"

Terra246,30,"Heya I’m a male in his 20s. I’ve been diagnosed with adhd for almost of my life. I’ve been off my adhd for awhile, I had bad experiences with them before, but after experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression, taking meds for both and only seeing slight improvements, I decided after talking to my family and others in here, to really advocate to my psychiatrist that adhd medicine could help me. He agreeded, he was hesitant at first due to stimulants being able to raise anxiety, but he also said that adhd can be a helpful adjunct medication for depression, for those with or without adhd. It is the same medicine from my teenage years, so it’s better stuff but it wasn’t always my favorite from what little I can remember. I think now I am older, am on other medicines, and on a lower dose of this adhd medicine Focalin XR 10 milligrams, I feel like I have a shot at not feeling empty for most of the day. I’m a bit nervous that it wouldn’t help, or this and that, but I want to be optimistic. If this doesn’t work, I’m not sure what will, but man I’m kinda excited if I’m being honest. Am I crazy to be a bit excited and nervous? My anxiety has been so crazy, kinda hard to remeber what normal excitement is like."
FaithInStrangers94,33,"It’s well documented we have quite abysmal short term/ working memories but what’s your longer term memory like?   I actually feel like I can recall things rather well… but usually strange extraneous details like the conversation I had with someone before the movie started rather than the dialogue from the movie, or the route I took in the Uber rather than details from the party lol  It seems that I remember that which I attach the most emotion to, and that’s not really something that can be faked as far as I’m aware.  There are a few tv shows, courses, events and so on where I can’t really remember anything from but others where I can recall lots of detail that others have most likely forgotten   What’s yours like?"
Terra246,30,"Hello everyone, I’m a 20 something male with adhd, GAD, and depression. I’m posting here because I feel so hopeless. I can’t focus on anything, I’m anxious and sad all the time. I wake up not wanting to get out of bed, then once I’m out of bed, I start crying. When I’m done crying I mediate and try and calm down with videos and games. It’s either they don’t distract me enough or I’m afraid that I have limited time and get anxious again, start to feel empty. I’m getting medicated heavily for the depression and anxiety, I’m seeing a therapist, and I’m still like this, it’s been months. I can’t take much more of this, I’m so tired of doing this every single day. People just tell me to wait, but I’m sick of it. I can’t stand these emotions, they are too much. I don’t know if posting here helps or not or if someone can help, I just want something to help."

Terra246,30,"Heya all I’m a male in his 20s. I’ve been diagnosed with adhd for most of my life. Had friends who had it, but besides “take medicine to go to school” I wasn’t really taught why I was taking medicine (besides just focus) and how adhd can impact other aspects of my life. For awhile I wasn’t sure if I had it or not. But this is intro is just so you know that I want to know more about having adhd, seeing some of the puzzle pieces fit into place. Today I’m feeling better so I thought of a more light hearted one. Did anyone else daydream a lot about random scenarios in their head? For me it would be becoming this cool guy who saves the day from (insert antagonist here). Sometimes it would be more realistic stuff, like now being able to go to Europe with my friends. Even when doing trips like that, a lot of times my brain will over romantice what could happen, like I’ll meet this many new people, fall in love, when everytime, I just go to a place, talk to the people around me and do the safe things. I’m curious if anyone else has that or it’s just a me thing. For now my obsessive thought is going to Europe or Japan with friends or going to Disney with friends."
FaithInStrangers94,33,One of the principal sources of my anxiety is knowing that if I don’t strongly filter what I say I’ll not only turn away and or offend many people in my life but probably be committed to a goddamn mental asylum - but filtering yourself comes at a price of course.  So my psychologist recommended that I stop seeing things being performance and over analysing things… but then also suggests that I should think more before I speak… which seem to be at complete odds with each other.   What do you guys think?
Terra246,30,"Hello all. I have the all three, depression, anxiety and adhd. Honestly would wake up either so anxious that I have an emotional outburst or a panic attack. Also wake up not wanting to get out of bed, just wanting to sleep (depression). Also most things don’t feel as good and I notice that it’s hard for me to just do one thing, I cycle through like 5 apps on my phone throughout the day. My psychiatrist wants to treat the anxiety and depression first, and I’m on medicine for that, which makes sense. I just wonder if adhd medicine would help out. Like would taking adhd medicine help improve my mood? I get that most adhd medicines are stimulants that could raise my anxiety, but I’m curious if it would help. I feel like a stimulant junkie, looking for something fun all the time. I’m curious what you all think, if anyone has been in a similar situation, if they had to advocate for themselves. I would love to hear everyone’s thoughts or if you wanna just give me support with a comment, all are appreciated and thank you."
Terra246,30,"Hello all, I’ll be honest, I’ve been feeling really depressed recently. I’m thankfully get help for this, medication (only for anxiety and depression) and therapy, but that dread in my stomach rarely goes away. I feel like the depression comes from me not getting enough stimulation (work doesn’t provide it for me and i feel isolated most of the week) but then when I want to try something new, the anxiety kicks in. The new is scary and my brain will get antsy thinking, maybe even hyper focusing on the negative or the what ifs, mostly “I could have been home doing something but instead I did this and im afraid and anxious”. I feel like with covid, the under stimulation really is hitting me, and I feel like that’s part of the reason that im depressed now. Gaming, anime and YouTube can only do so much. I guess I wanted to hear if anyone else experiences this and what they do to help it. Or if this is a weirdly specific thing or not. Any help or support would be appreciated and thank you all for reading this long post."

FaithInStrangers94,33,"I had a panic attack and the most formidable suicidal ideation ive ever had last week during a horrid comedown from Ritalin - I felt anxious the next few days and I haven’t dared to take it since then.   I’m not sure why exactly, the first week I took it the comedown wasn’t too rough; then it got worse and worse over the next week until it resulted in that.   Has anyone else experienced something similar?   I know stimulants are notorious for provoking anxiety at least during the comedown, but I wasn’t expecting this since I’ve never really suffered from such intense anxiety before"

I’m a 20 something year old male who is a therapist part time over zoom pretty much. My clients are not the easiest to deal with and it being virtual is nice in some aspects, but also hard in others.

MenuTime5231,32,"I have been run by this narrative for the entirety of our relationship.i can see various examples of self sabotage I've used to keep this mindset up. This is how my brain views it:  When I am my true self I feel I can be very attractive. I feel like my sense of humor is a big asset. When I am my true self I have this swagger where everything comes together. I'm funny so people enjoy being around me, my confidence grows because I'm being liked, I feel comfortable because I'm liked, that comfortableness makes others feel comfortable around me. All these things involved make me feel attractive. The more people I socialize with as I come out of my shell the more people I will run into who may be Inappropriate and disrespectful of my marriage which would make me uncomfortable and anxious of if I did something to send the wrong vibes.  I experienced a lot of rejection in life so I have difficulties rejecting someone else. I also fear that I will mistake people who are just being nice as them making overtures towards me which make them feel like I've painted them in a certain negative way.   I grew up sheltered and I've had moments of being outgoing when I was younger but I've always been lived more introverted so I don't know what it's like to be among high status people and how higher status people operate"

I know I could go if I wanted to, I know I don't have any real reason so I feel bad to do it to people who are my friends."

FaithInStrangers94,33,"I’ve realised that some of my ADHD symptoms might be attributable to pretty extreme anxiety (brain fog, inability to focus, insomnia, even poor memory) and stimulant medication would often make them better for a short while before making them much worse.   Does anyone have experience with both conditions?   Did treating anxiety help with ADHD symptoms as well?"
MenuTime5231,32,"We did a improv exercise today that I felt was so cringy and that I only saved it with my humor, turns out I was considered the best one in the group. My superiors even said they saw a part of me that theyve never seen before being comfortable and outgoing.  I ran into an acquaintance at Target and we stood and had great flowing conversation for 10 to 15 mins without it being overkill. When we walked away my wife patted me on the back and told me that she normally has to do all the talking but I did great.   Today was a day I just feel this sense that Ive made great progress, like I've finally gotten to a place of no return. I'm not spending everyday TRYING to feel good. I just feel good. My confidence has grown, I've opened up out of my shell and turns out this guy I try to hide is actually pretty wanted and appreciated. My relationships with people I always felt so distant to at work now feel closer. One thing I always long for is just to feel like I'm inside the club of life. To not feel so inadequate to the point I can't conversate is so freeing. Today I felt like I was inside the club and I felt like I belonged.   Just very thankful for my life right now. Really feels like I can understand it now when people say to be happy where you are in life right now."
MenuTime5231,32,"Guys life has been stellar recently. I know one thing that will always hold me back from being at my best from a confidence standpoint is fear of being looked at or become an egotistical self centered prick. I fear this because as a kid I was massively insecure, at the end of highschool I discovered self improvement and started changing my situation, as a young adult my 'confidence"" warped into being a thoughtless ""the world revolves around me because I'm the greatest thing on earth"" I got laid alot like this so I didn't have much incentive to stop until my friends called me out and cut me off until I changed. I changed and eventually met my wife who helped me understand what being an actual human being was. I had massive regret that coincided with the MeToo movement and reading stories of douchebags that sounded a lot like me as a younger guy. I've possibly been TOO humble over the past 6 years. I look back at my past ""success"" with shame and regret.  I've had some of the biggest wins of my career just in the past month. People ask me why I'm not more excited or tell me I need to brag more than I do. I am super proud and happy for myself but I find myself being bashful and overly humble. All my success can be explained therefore I find myself devaluing my hard work. ""I've made X amount of money this month BUT I WOULDNT HAVE THAT IF MY COWORKER WASNT SICK WITH COVID"" Things like that. I've gradually become more embracing of my success by making jokes or quips but I know a voice keeps saying ""be careful don't look like a cocky prick"" even if I'm not really being prickish."

Then I get bored, look at my Twitter, close out of that, look at my discord, sometimes look at my email or weather.

MenuTime5231,32,"TL:Dr Im not good with things being hot then cold in friendships. We all have lives and everything. It isn't always personal I know that but I don't think having people that make you wonder where you stand with them are healthy to have. I also know it's not healthy to have high standards of friendship that I'm not hitting 100% on either or healthy to spaz out when a friend isnt sending out the vibes I want either.  Friendships are an area I'm focusing on improving in my life. I had a moment yesterday that I took a mental note of.  A few months back I had an issue with someone I considered a close friend. I met someone who heard the story and really focused on making me feel worthy. They call and invite me out, check on me, take the time to tell me that this friend wasnt really my friend. After a month, I felt great and worthy about my life and people in it.   My friend got busy with things, got Covid, had other friends to spend time with and we didn't have a lot of contact other than checking in when sick a few times and sending our normal jokes that weren't getting responses back on.   Yesterday we all got together and we didn't speak the entire time other than hello. I mentioned how long it had been and everything was pretty dismissive ""yeah it's like that sometimes"" I sat like someone killed my puppy the whole trip down. My wife got tired of it and made a comment then later told me that she thought I was spazzing over nothing because when she talked to them they wondered why I was being so quiet and upset looking.  We eventually talked and things were okay but I had a very depressive pain body for 2 hours feeling like all my friendships end up the same and that I can't seem to maintain a friendship. Having no or very little friends already magnifies the issue."
FaithInStrangers94,33,"Just this morning I posted here rhapsodising Ritalin… it’s my 6th day on it and so far it’s been working well and feeling like a natural focus… well today I took it as usual and the focus was a little more robotic than the previous days, nonetheless I got through some rather boring work… then about 4 hours after taking it I noticed I was feeling off… this got more and more intense until it felt as though my brain had been scraped out and sludge poured into my cranium.  I had a one on one study session with a girl I’m low key interested in and I could barely think at all - it’s as if my short term memory was erased. All I wanted to do was sit in silence. My emotion was completely drained from me; I was like a psychopath, she told me something that would ordinarily excite me and I just stared with dead eyes, I couldn’t even pretend to care. I felt dizzy and disoriented - when I closed my eyes I felt like I didn’t even exist.   I wrapped up the study session saying I had a headache and skipped a family birthday dinner saying the same thing. I went straight home, took panadol and just lay on my bed like a vacant soul.  2 hours later and I’m more or less feeling back to myself.   What the fuck was all that about? I made sure to eat and drink today and I had 7 hours sleep last night   Have you guys ever had a crash that bad?   I don’t think I’ll ever take the shit again"
FaithInStrangers94,33,"I’ve only been taking Ritalin for a week after taking various amphetamines for about 10 years.  Ritalin feels more natural ( perhaps due to the fact it’s a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor rather than an agonist). It’s less energy producing but allows me to focus in a more subtle way. It doesn’t effect my appetite or ability to pop wood - it feels like me on a rare occasion that I can focus naturally such as when there’s a massive deadline due the next day. The crash is very noticeable, it’s like you’re deflating, but it’s over within an hour or 2 and then you’re back to normal.   Amphetamine (adderall and dex) is more intense and gives me some euphoria but that can lead me to dancing around or revelling in the feeling of being amped up, then I’ll managed to settle down and focus for a while and feel a bit robotic before a crash that isn’t as physically intense but leaves you feeling uneasy for the rest of the day in my experience.   I’m very surprised to discover that methylphenidate actually seems to serve me better - it’s not as “fun” and like amphetamine it does make me feel a bit robotic, but it seems to deliver a very natural focus.  It’s a bit early to say conclusively, but just sharing my experience thus far   Does anyone else here prefer Ritalin?"
Terra246,30,"Hey everyone, I’m a 20 something old male here. Been diagnosed with adhd since a young age but besides given medicine, it wasn’t until recently that I started to really understand what having adhd meant besides “take medicine to focus”. I say this because I’m still not sure what is and is not part of my adhd, thus my question. Normally on the weekends I hang out with friends and have a blast. I get a bit anxious when things die down or when I start to realize how much time we have left. Once it is Sunday and I’m not hanging with friends, I get a bit sad. My brain starts to think about starting the week over again and gets stressed out. I start to think about how I should have done something else with my friends, or that time could slow down when I was with them. I am not sure if this is an adhd thing or not. Also not really sure how to make things better. I’m open to suggestions and thank hou for reading my post."
MenuTime5231,32,"Headline says it all. I went to dump the bucket and it fell out of my hand and cracked the tank which is pretty vital to it. I had a lot of debate to spend the money I did on it and now it's broke.   My normal behavior is to call myself an idiot. I have the worst luck. How was I so careless. If I don't, I'm sure when I tell my partner she will say something insinuating how careless I was."
FaithInStrangers94,33,"And my mid term memory isn’t much better (my long term memory seems decent enough)   But my god things just go in one eye/ear and straight out the other. I constantly forget where I parked, forget someone’s name when I meet them, even forget what I’m saying midway through a sentence.  Its fucked me over at work, and is making me think twice about returning to study psychology   Even when I try to focus all my attention and be present in the moment I’m lucky if I retain anything   Yet I have a jukebox in my head that can play about 8000 songs from start to finish… makes me wonder. And I’ll remember random details like the bird carcass I passed on the way to class, but none of the content…   Anyway how have you guys managed to improve your short term memory? Besides the obvious like writing notes and voice memos and stuff"
MenuTime5231,32,"Not only this but I also feel the shame of not doing enough. It doesn't matter if I accomplish alot during the day or sit around all day. I don't feel like I really have time where I say ""Man I did alot today I'm going to take it easy and enjoy a movie"" I'll sit there to watch a movie and feel like ""Why am I watching a movie. All I ever do is sit around. I'm going to die one day"" I'll regret watching the movie which isn't fun.   I work a lot of hours. I've gotten better about taking time off but still long hours. When I get free time I feel like I need to squeeze every moment before I go back to work but the reality is that there's other responsibilities I have at home as a husband and I have executive disfunction about what I could do that I would enjoy and eventually sit around doing nothing and feeling negative feelings over not doing anything. I have a difficult time feeling satisfied."
FaithInStrangers94,33,"My parents call this a sly excuse - I say it’s a far more humanising perspective that doesn’t just dismiss the individual as being “lazy” but analyses the sources of the “laziness” to help them conquer it either through medicating the underlying disorders, behavioural therapy or analysing values and aspirations to determine whether the given task is in alignment and whether it’s even necessary.   Besides, what the fuck even is laziness?  If you deeply valued something and had no depression, anxiety, ADHD etc impeding you, you would be pursuing it. Obviously.   It goes against human nature to simply decide not to do something which we perceive as being wroth the effort…unless of course we have an ulterior motive such as trying to sabotage someone else (or indeed ourselves).  Approaching from this angle has afforded me a much greater insight into my relationship with certain tasks rather than simply discounting myself as being a lazy cunt (which only adds to self hatred and perpetuates “laziness”)    My 2 cents"

FaithInStrangers94,33,"I’m not referring the caveman era, rather my grandfather was recalling life in the 40s and 50s yesterday and It struck me how much simpler and dare I say easier it would’ve been for people with an attention deficit disorder.   As I sit here now I could be messaging any number for friends, replying to emails, mindlessly browsing social media, watching porn, watching a documentary, film, tv show, Youtube, podcast, listen to any song ever recorded, learn any new skill online, online shopping, FaceTime, drive to the shops and buy any amount of processed sugary foods, alcohols, buy any drug using telegram, get on dating  apps, hire Uber eats, hire a goddamn escort if I feel so inclined… we’re surrounded constantly by near infinite sources of instantaneous dopamine release and we don’t even have to leave our bedroom for most of them.   As we know from the neurological literature, available dopamine dips majorly after a high release and is dependent on the intensity of prior releases; if you’ve just watched the finale of your favourite tv show whilst stuffing your face with your favourite snack, studying a dull subject afterwards is going to seem insanely challenging. No wonder so many people are reporting feelings of apathy and presenting with shortened attention spans that mimic adhd.  My grandfather told me how the only real options as a kid in the 40s was spending time with the family playing board games, studying without distraction, reading a book or going outside and playing with friends if they were around - or working. Occasionally you would go to a play or the cinema.   I don’t envy people living in this era - the relative lack of opportunities, comforts and conveniences plus the archaic medicine and institutional oppression, repressed self expression and so on are lamentable by today’s standards - but I can’t help but feel like life would’ve been a little easier for someone with ADHD.   What’s your thoughts?"
FaithInStrangers94,33,"I always assumed I was real anxious and introverted deep down but I’ve realised that I do actually enjoy socialising for the most part (depends on the context of course)   The reason I rarely seem to go to events and things is because I hate having too many commitments and the planning required - I’ll usually forget to buy tickets, fail to arrange transport or check my calendar so it doesn’t clash with something etc it becomes too stressful - rather chill at home   Once I’m out I’ll probably be having a better time than I would at home ( altho do get drained by social interaction after a while).  This is something I want to challenge because there will come a time where I’m too old to be going to local gigs or beach parties, festivals even social sports.   I also thought I had no drive to explore the world but I realise I love travelling - I just hate the massive amounts of planning and preparation that’s involved ( even if you do it on a whim)   I just don’t know how some people work full time then pack their free time with camping trips and festivals etc.. a lack of executive dysfunction and a higher drive to socialise I guess   Who else relates?"

If I'm not working or with my wife I'm alone.   Friendship for me would make me feel like a quality person. People would think fondly of me and want to be a part of each other's lives. I would enjoy the closeness that comes with friendship. I want what I imagine other people's close friendships feel like.   I would say I currently have a unhealthy association with friendship as I only have a deep long term friendship with 1 person that isn't my wife. The rest are coworkers, people that say they are friends but don't fit my view of how friends treat each other, and acquaintances that I kinda long for to be friends with.  I usually end up disappointed when I find out their extreme political views or LGBTQ phobic, racial views. Living where I live it's unfortunately common.

Terra246,30,"Hello, I of course have adhd. Recently with a new stressful job, my anxiety has gone up. I’m seeing people for that and that’s not why I’m here. I notice that my go tos for when I’m anxious, anime, YouTube and games haven’t been giving me the same level of satisfaction that they use to. I constantly feel “burned out” on games and watch more than one anime at a time to keep things “fresh”. I have wanted to find new hobbies for awhile, but I’m not sure where to start. I was wondering if anyone here could give me some suggestions for what hobbies really help them out during hard times?"
MenuTime5231,32,"I have recently noticed a few people that I've talked to by phone have this thing were after you say something it's they pause for a few seconds before responding. It's thrown me off and the interaction I just had initially made me question if I was just being Akward Mcawkwardson.   Me: Hey! It's Menutime! How are you doing?  Person:.....hi menutime. I'm doing great how are you?  Me: I'm doing great. While I got you on the line I meant to call you last week to wish you a happy birthday so happy belated. How was it?  Person:.......thank you.It was great.   Me: good good. Well I just had a quick question...*business details*  But those pauses really made me feel like ""oh God, she's so uncomfortable right now . She's pausing because she thinks its mad fucking wierd that a guy that she infrequently sees remembered her birthday but is reaching out to her to say happy birthday a week later while she's working""  She's someone who in person has always been extremely perky and her positive energy was great. Today felt like she was distracted."
MenuTime5231,32,"A few weeks ago I opened up to a higher up about my stress and reasons why I may not be operating like I could be. Ever since, people have been kinder and across the board they have been more mindful of how they communicate things to us. People check on me everyday and ask how I am doing etc. All that is great but can't help to feel sometimes it is patronizing but I'm willing to accept that it may be my ADHD making me see things that way.  I want people to treat me well by showing appreciation for things I do, be kind, be mindful of how certain things can negatively affect me but I don't want people to only act a certain way because they are afraid that I may cause them harm if I have a mental episode. Anyone mind helping me untangle this knot?"

I developed depersonalisation disorder after a bad drug trip, it’s improved a bit over the years but I’ve heard a few people with ADHD describe feeling somewhat similar - dissociated like you’re never really in the moment and always stuck in your own head.  When I’m medicated I turn sort of robotic and just plough through work like an automaton.  I’m wondering to what degree this might be an ADHD thing, or why your experience has been like?"

foooood4thought,13,"How to exercise with ADHD with no effort  As you are walking to the grocery store, hold some weights in your hands, or as you are walking somewhere, even walking around the house.  You can simply droop your arms to the ground, and hang the weights down at your sides. Thus, there is no effort involved, no timing involved.  I feel like ADHD is a ""time disorder"" along with difficulty in starting complex physical routines.  We might struggle with stuff like, doing press-ups, sit-ups, but we can succeed at stuff like simply drooping weights to our side.  Yesterday, I was holding some heavy bags coming back from the shopping centre, and it felt amazing. The exercise of just working the muscles like this, gave me the ""juice"" to really get stuff done that day. It felt amazing.  Consistently I find that when I have to do things that involve timing out my own exercise, that I can't do it. Sure, that's because we lack a timer in our heads.  So, we just need to do exercise that involves no timing at all, such as, walking, while holding weights to the side.  Also note, how holding weights, and it feels like they are getting heavier and heavier and heavier, until your arm is going to be ""ripped off"". So, this is the ADHD ""gun to the head"", ""escalating ticking down timer"" kind of concept.  This is precisely the kind of timer that we respond to. It's like in the game shows or the video games, where the timer gets more and more intense as it ticks down to the end. Same with these weights, getting heavier and heavier until you give up.  It's a bit like the World's Strongest Man competitions, where they carry a heavy thing while walking, as long as they can, before dropping it in exhaustion. That's how ADHD exercise should be like."

I appreciate good law enforcement and I don't hate THEM but I hate the feelings they typically give me based on my own ""trauma""  As a white guy its almost disrespectful for me to consider tickets as traumatic incidents when people of color have FAR more traumatic experiences to talk about.  To my point, my record is pretty clean. Ive gotten tickets for speeding, illegal turn, lapsed registration and was let go after a DUI stop (the scariest incident) They were all justified but those experiences of being fearful of getting tickets I couldn't afford, insurance being sky high, living with parents at the time I was deathly afraid of them finding out have really stuck with me. The association people have with law enforcement doesn't help either. I never know what type of cop I will run into so when they are riding my ass I get panicky worrying if I'm speeding, worried if everything is up to date, worried that the person will frame me for something, worried if I make a move I might make this person afraid for their life. Etc.  I mean no disrespect to law enforcement. I'm thankful for all the good ones that keep us safe and everything but cops never pulled me over to give me a briefcase of money or anyhting"

MycologistAdvanced24,43,My aspie friend is always turning round or looking around if he is in my vicinity or passing  my house.

Does anyone else get this? Almost like your eyes are so impressionable that the image just sticks around (sort of like when you look at a really bright light, but for everything you look at)?

joost666,7,Overanalyzing feeds the fear. Don't do that. Try to act in spite of the fear.  [The link](https://youtu.be/eACv26uAG5I)  I think this is really applicable to Aspies as we tend to overanalyze way too much to search for a perfect solution.
SpektrumKid,2,"It doesn’t happen often. I can’t honestly think when it last happened, but have you ever extinguished the interest in one subject, for then not having another to get right on?  It feels weird. I’ve been obsessing about my eye sight for months and finally come to the end of it. Before that I was obsessing about my newly diagnosed autism, but I also come to the end of that, although that will always be the primary interest as it’s in the journey of self understanding and discovery. And that never ends.   But what now? What if there isn’t any new interest? What do you do with your time then?

joost666,7,"Online it states that students have to let their work graded every week. Then the teacher says: show me at the end of the asignment (after 3 weeks) and just upload the theory questions every week.   I have been working extra hard to get it done before the worklessson and then he does not follow the rules he is supposed to.  This happens a lot: there is often some deadline or rule online that a teacher doesn't follow.  Also a student was supposed to be graded  on an internship based on a lot of criteria. Instead the teacher asked: "" what grade do you want"".  I don't understand people. Rules/acceptance criteria are supposed to be followed and I expect people to follow them exactly. If they don't follow the rules, then don't create rules in the first place! Why not just say: it is good if you do x, but you don't have to or something like that.   People are often making their own rules or sometimes create exceptions to them.  How am I supposed to know which rule will be enforced and which one not, if people don't communicate this?

foooood4thought,13,"I have been trying something interesting lately.  I've been not using the English language as much  I feel as if normal human language is confusing us  We subliminally misinterpret words sounds  We interpret falsely words within words, a bit like a rapper  We might even have a mathematical tendency to even move up and down the word shapes like they are some train track or rollercoaster ride or something  Normal humans communicate 70 pct of their information using ""non-verbal cues""  Normal humans could not even tell you what these cues in particular are  I asked an expert on Reddit and he could not even tell me what in particular these eye movements even are conveying  Should we even be using human language at all?  Or should we purely be thinking in our heads?  Should we be thinking in patterns, shapes, drawings, some weird Math language?  If autistic people don't even look at people in the eyes, we are literally missing 70 pct of all communication  Imagine sending data down an Ethernet cable on the Internet and losing 70 pct of the data packets. The information would just come out as garbage nonsense  Other humans also have a much greater short term working memory  Therefore, it's like they are speaking in 64-bit ""instruction set size"" and we are speaking in 8-bit. We are going to immediately get behind and never catch up  Furthermore, the human brain subconsciously does pick up these eye movements, but misinterprets them. Especially since we don't do them properly when we have autism  Therefore, people often get upset at us, even though we are just standing there and doing nothing"

SpektrumKid,2,"I’ve been dealing with this dot in my eye which incidentally has forced me to look deep into how my super focus works. I basically get caught in a catch 22 wherever I look, because that black dot floats around and reminds me of that one day I was being careless and looked into a very bright projector.   Now, I’m starting to understand how my focus works. When I don’t think about it, it almost becomes invisible.   Much like the times when I was working on a specific project and couldn’t hear my stomach growl.   Or when I was obsessing about some girl that wanted nothing to do with me, but I forgot about my friends.   Or when I fixated on becoming the best musician but lost my home because I wasn’t paying attention to anything else.    My eye injury is basically forcing me to train myself to disengage my hyper focus and take a minute.   It’s super difficult because there’s always something that takes my focus, and I realize how many hours and days and weeks I can be ‘gone’ and only realize later how completely enthralled I was in whatever I was fixating on.   It’s like being snapped out of a spell.   Maybe there’s a training thing one can do to get the hang of it, so we don’t suffer from getting sucked into things that are detrimental to our health?"

No-Watercress-9116,10,so I met this girl through a mutual friend. we were in a class and she lives near me so I went back home with her.

foooood4thought,13,"I am not a paranoid schizophrenic. I don't even have Schizotypal Personality Disorder. I don't even have Paranoid Personality Disorder.  I don't believe that I have any personality disorder.  I believe that I have ADHD, autism, dyspraxia, alongside some odd nutritional reactions or allergies, the worst of which seems to be dairy.  Now we've gotten that out of the way.  There is a mental disorder, where people believe that their loved ones have been replaced by impersonators.  I am raising this, because autistic people are known to have social difficulty. Including myself. I find it very difficult to make new friends, or want to make new friends.  I spent a large amount of time of my life, reading online about spying, CIA, Wikileaks, Snowden, conspiracy theories, this kind of stuff.  So far as I can tell, the only way to accurately identify someone, would be with cameras and satellites, where you follow their movements over time.  After all, someone can:  1. Change hair colour 2. Change weight 3. Get older, or with new life extension technology, get younger, perhaps 4. Change gender 5. Wear very different clothes 6. Wear Islamic clothing, full face veil, etc 7. Elderly people can shrink in height with age 8. Children grow in height with age 9. Change skin colour even, Michael Jackson stuff, or even, Rachel Dolezal 10. Use fake accents. Sam Vaknin is a diagnosed psychopath who says his entire voice is fake. Psychopaths will invent an entirely fictional character 11. Change house, neighborhood, area 12. Get scarring or burns on the face that make them unrecognisable 13. Fake breasts  And it goes on  CIA has an entire video on YouTube where their ""master of disguise"" expert, talks about how she can turn anyone into anyone  Hollywood movies even will have very realistic looking disguises  This doesn't even mention, in hallucinations or psychosis, you might even hallucinate someone's face falsely  There are also mental conditions where you struggle to recognise human faces  So how do you possibly recognise someone?  It's probably illegal where you live, but even if you placed a GPS tag on someone, the GPS could be hacked, or the person could find the GPS and remove it or tamper with it  Or, what if you just went full ""domestic abuser"" and locked someone up in the house and didn't let them leave? Well, that's illegal. And you risk being jailed. Many autistic people fall into the trap of becoming domestic abusers, or being stuck in domestic abuse themselves  How can a person be sure that CIA hasn't infiltrated your wife and turned her against you?  How can you be sure that spies didn't kill or kidnap your wife and replace her with a fake?  The only way you could ever be REALLY sure, would be to trace someone's movements from birth to death. From the moment they are born in the hospital, to the moment they die. They are captured on camera.  Even then, this would have to ensure, that no trap doors or secret tunnels underground, where people could swap person. The entire city would have to be paved with concrete surely. Or maybe a secret spy camera in the house would send police to raid you, if it caught you in the process of building such a tunnel.  Other than that, there are theoretical ""wormholes"" or ""portals"" in time, that you might see in video games like The Orange Box. The Portal I think was a game on XBOX 360. Physicists have theorised about this. But clearly no such proof. I think scientists did recently teleport something very microscopic.  So, basically this is where autistic people are basically trying to take the job of government spies.  Because you would need your own access to satellites, CCTV, and secret cameras, to ever identify who is who.  And the real spies would not want you having such access, because then, you could out them.   Your government's spies, whichever country you live in, want a monopoly on who gets to wear disguises and be untraceable. They want it to be them. Not you.  So unless you were a government spy, I don't think there is any such legal way to identify a person.  The only way, would be to change the law, where average people are given access to such surveillance tools.  Even then, you could not be sure that governments were not feeding you fake video footage from their cameras.  Notice how CCTV footage is often grainy and low quality. Police often ask the public for help in identifying someone, even if they are caught on camera, due to how low quality the  images are.  The best way to identify your girlfriend, therefore, would be to do so by her behaviours.  This is the big conclusion that I reached with autism and socialising.   This is the reason that people act so conformist and ""the same"" and ""sheep like"" socially.  It is so that they can accurately identify one another.  This may explain why autistic people are so paranoid socially. Because we are too fancy in how we act, how we behave.  Whether it's talking on and on too long.  Whether it's missing 70 pct of communication because we don't do non-verbal cues very well. Apparently 70 pct of all communication is conveyed non-verbally. And autistic people simply don't correctly read eye and facial movements. We missed that entire part of our development as early babies.  Whether it's having obscure topics that are out of place.  Whether it's just our blunt affect and lack of facial expression.  Whether it's that we are just here to do pure work and not take part in the social aspects of things.  This is probably the reason, that autistic people, who do succeed in socialising, do so over very limited topics.  For example, I used to have a suspected autistic friend at school. And we bonded over things like, certain TV shows. Nickelodeon. Video games. Pokémon. Same music. Even wearing the same clothes for the band.   I feel as if autistic friendships are going to have to be based around common interests.  The way that you tell if someone is in your side, is if they are still into Pokémon, or Nickelodeon, or golfing, or skateboarding, or whatever it is.  Because we clearly suck at doing this continual rapid form of socialising that others do, that seems to involve rapidly conveying information with eye movements.  I used to say to my autistic friend, Pokémon is lame. Golf is lame. And that's when he stopped hanging out with me. Or that's when he indicated that he was pushing away from me.  So, you may well have to pretend that you like these hobbies.  Furthermore, if you confronted a new person, that you had never met before, and quizzed them on their knowledge of this hobby, then that would probably indicate that they weren't faking it.  For example, if you told someone in advance, that you were into Pokémon. They could then go home and check the fan pages and trivia, and fake an interest in it.  Another way to test someone to ensure that they are not a psychopath tricking you, would be to drag out the friendship over time. I know that sucks with ADHD, because we don't like waiting for things.   But that is what makes a friendship or relationship, is putting up with shit that you don't like. This is in contrast to a work, job, employment, which is all about how efficiently and productively you can work.  I am still trying to work it all out. But I'm pretty sure there is no clever way to identify an impersonator. Plus, I'm pretty sure, that's the kind of thing that spies themselves would do, to prevent society falling apart, with all these impersonator people everywhere.  And what can you do if a proper government spy decides they are going to make friends and girlfriends with you? Nothing, other than, staying out of relationships altogether.  Feel free to add your own theories here."

SpektrumKid,2,"Hey everyone. I’m getting to the age where my eyes are starting to fail. I need glasses but I can never find them.   I’ve been considering contacts forever, but I’m worried about sticking my fingers in my eye and scratching my cornea, or causing an infection.   I like those variables to be as close to zero as possible, and as long as I don’t wear contacts I don’t have to worry about it. But I can tell the toll it’s taking on my life to most of the time not have things in focus. It’s a strain on my brain.   So I figured that if other autistics can figure out contacts, maybe I can too?  Are there any of you that use them, and how has your experience been, safety wise and comfort wise?

I would describe this, in very physical terms  I would describe this, as ""electrical energy"" (dopamine) building up in your brain  You need to transfer this energy, to your larger muscles and nerves  Instead of large ""current"" or ""voltage"" of electricity overwhelming the smaller ""nerves"" (neurons)  Instead of overwhelming your neurons, you need to re-route the ""electricity"" to your other larger nerves  These larger nerves are larger, and can handle it better  The way to do this, is by squeezing and unsqueezing your hands  The way to do this, is by flexing and unflexing your arm muscles  The way to do this, even, is to use your larger muscles  This will stop your poor little brain being overwhelmed with too much ""electricity"" and ""panicking"" and even ""short circuiting""  Your nervous system is one big electrical circuit  And you need to redirect the electricity away from this one component, your brain  This is why exercise is shown to help depression  You should do this exercise, while doing other stuff  As in, you should multi task  You should read a book on your phone, while flexing your arm muscles  You should read a book on your phone, while clenching and unclenching your hand  Use your left hand to hold the book, and your right hand to do the exercise  Swap hands later  This is how to stop infinite overthinking  Overthinking has no basis in reality  Over-thinking is like needlessly breaking things into tiny chunks  If you were to write down your thoughts, this would be merely microscopic ""finger exercise""  You can save endless hours of finger exercise, by instead doing just a few big broad arm or leg exercises  You can therefore convert multiple hours of going over the same stuff, into just a few minutes of exercising while reading new stuff"
joost666,7,"Some lessons are on school location, some online. Sometimes lessons online are on the same day as physical lessons. Lessons are on different times all over the week. Every week is different with scheduling.   How can I keep planning fulltime hours if they change it up every week? I can't be productive enough without exhausting myself. If every week was the same I could build an effective routine. I could set up different reminders and timers for my weekly routine. Now, I can't."

PeteyZee1998,24,"My stimming is not very visible in public, it usually looks like subtle rocking, or fidgeting, sometimes I feel so excited I don’t even know I’m doing it but feel an enormous amount of pleasure.

Competitive_Bid7071,16,I’ve personally had lots of issues with very annoying people in my personal life who don’t seem to respect my basic requests that well. For instance they’ll just come into my room without warning while I’m working on things or reading a book and it’s incredibly annoying. Sometimes they purposely come in to bug me and tackle and hit me just so they can seemingly get reactions out of me or for some other reason they don’t bother to explain. I’ve tried locking my door or placing up a “do not disturb” sign but they still won’t listen to me. How do you handle situations like this? Because I personally hate getting lots of stress from these things.

foooood4thought,13,"Next time you are reading something, try deliberately blurring your eyes when reading.  I used to do this at school in a very extreme way, in not wearing my glasses at all. Hence, no choice over blurred vision.  But since, I have gotten laser eye surgery, and thus, default mode of vision is sharp.  Thus, I deliberately kind of criss-cross my eyes. To create a slightly blurred effect when reading.  I find that this helps me to read.  It's as if simply looking at the page and my brain sees the entire page as a photograph, and says, I've already looked at it, and within seconds, wants to look away from the page and onto something new.  By blurring the text, it creates constant ""newness"" or ""movement"", which is also useful if you have ADHD alongside your autism.  I believe that this may also have something to do with ""light sensitivity"", which is a common sensory issue."

SpektrumKid,2,"I take them to dilate my eyes slightly so I can’t see all the imperfections in my vitreous gel in my eyes.

So I’m asking here for best practices and what I should prepare for, should I ever get an eye infection?  Should I get antibiotic eye drops preemptively just in case anything bad happens?  As an aspie it’s always difficult for me to see long term consequences of my actions, but I know that bacterial build up can happen so I’m storing them in the fridge.   I just wonder if there’s a way one can decontaminate eye drops? Can I put them in the microwave or boil the containers in water? Just to make 100% sure there’s zero bacteria in there?

I seem to not be able to just work casually and slowly, like it is a normal thing I am doing, but with a sort of perfectionism. I want to pass everything in one go, I want to present without mistakes, I want to be done with school as soon as possible and get a part-time job. I think this causes that. I'm just done with school. I am often trying to focus on the now only and only on learning , but that doesn't work that well. My brain just still wants to rush everything. It does the work well, but at a cost. A cost of time.   Also, context switches drain energy too, first having to watch a lecture, then prepare a presentation, then work on project, then do a home task.    Or going to school, sit there and watch a lecture and then doing a presentation. Then going home and still working on project is really hard. I barely have energy left.

joost666,7,"I want to work in IT, but I don't want to work this much. It is a full-time education, you are supposed to do 40 hours with two 40 hour week obligatory internships that I still have to do.   I get upset constantly because I don't want to dedicate my life to something, and letting other important/fun things go. I just want a part-time job after graduation. But before that happens I have to get through this.   I like programming, but I also want to play games, hang out with friends and family, play music, watch anime, movies and series.  With college there is a risk of getting a bad grade and having to do even more hours of work because of the resit. The resit time also intervenes with the time you have for the next semester or current assignment. I am constantly forced to work hard to get a good grade. It is not about passion anymore, but survival.   I wish I could just choose: I will only do school 20 hours a week.  I would probably fail a lot if I did that with the current program.  I have often no energy for games or to learn music because my energy was stolen by the education during the day.  Every night I am just watching anime or Netflix to try to compensate and be happy. However, that makes me tired the next day or set an alarm clock late in the morning so that I don't have much time during the day for school and fun.   If I can't find a part-time job after graduation, I will lose all will to live. For now, I am holding on with the hope that I can. I heard that in my country it is really an option. But it just takes a big toll to get to that point. I could step out and try to find such job now, but without a graduation, the chances of getting such job are lower."

Also my mom just randomly scheduled a dentist apointment. I don't want to do that if I need to do other things. My school schedule for that date is still unknown.   I don't understand why things need to be done in paralel. It still takes the same time if you do one at a time instead of planning all things together.  So why not first learn for the test, then take the test, then  afterwards do the project? Why not give me 2 weeks off to focus entirely on searching for the internship? Is paralel work really better somehow?"

SpektrumKid,2,"Maybe you’ve all read my posts but I injured my eye with a laser four years ago. Right around the same time I got diagnosed.   I know now why it even happened. I haven’t been able to relax in a room with myself since I was a kid because my mom would berate me for my autistic ways. Like I used to talk to myself all the time. But then I started feeling shameful about it because my mother said it made me sound like an R word.   So I stopped talking to myself. But boy that was a mistake. It’s fundamental to who I am. I’m a verbal thinker. I can’t think if I don’t say it.   Usually I’ve had friends around so I could offload some of my thoughts since I had stopped speaking to myself, but right around that time in 2017 I was losing friends left and right and I wound up spending way too much time alone. Well, too much time alone not talking to myself. And one fateful day in a mix of overconfidence, hyper fixating on whatever I was worried about at the time, I had my injury happen. I didn’t have the patience to read the instructions to a laser projector and i shot myself in the eye and left a scar.   A scar that when ever I’ve seen it since has sent an avalanche of feelings of shame and guilt down my gut which has of course severely distracted me. So much I was considering getting surgery and all sorts of things.   Now I realize I’ve just been berating myself in my head just like my mom would have for being a klutz. and the shame and guilt is why it’s been so distracting.   I’ve apparently felt shame and guilt no matter where I was, priming me and prompting me to do impulsive things from all the pent up emotion.   Now I talk to myself again and it’s a lot easier when you have an outlet for your thoughts. As soon as I lost the shame for speaking to myself, my dot in my eye seemed infinitely smaller and I immediately started reading a book. Something I didn’t think I could ever do again just a few days ago.   It’s important to talk to each other. But it’s also important to talk with yourself.   :)"

foooood4thought,13,"Hey guys.  I have autism, high functioning Asperger's variety  I would really consider applying for a job at McDonald's  I worked there for 3 years   The job is set up in precisely the way that works for an autism or ADHD brain  Everything is located physically out in the open. The sauces, the ingredients, the people, the cash register, everything.   You can ""see"" everything with your eyes  The job is quite fast-paced, which suits our ""workaholic"" mentality.  I'm very sure that many autistic people meet many of the symptoms of OCPD, which basically means ""workaholic"" condition  The job requires little to no language skills at all. Mostly because it's all a physical visual sensory job.  But also note, restaurants are largely staffed by migrants. As in, they don't speak good English, meaning, you can easily work the shift without having to talk to anyone.  The job interview itself lacks any of the utter bullshit nonsense of professional jobs. No lying and exaggerated answers. No fakery needed. Did I mention, many successful job interviews will involve little if no English?  In some parts of Florida, they are PAYING people to show up for McDonald's interviews. This is the precise opposite of how professional jobs work, where it's ultra competitive, workplace is full of dirty tricks, social tricks etc  The job can be learned fully at home, before showing up for your first shift. You can literally go on YouTube, watch videos of people working there. You can visit the website, and the ingredients of the burgers etc are all listed clearly.   No need to worry about not understanding neurotypicals and the utterly convoluted way that they often provide instructions.   Hell, many neurotypicals or narcissists don't just fail to provide instructions for jobs. They go even further, and outright lie and trick you, to get you fired from the job.   It is very difficult if not impossible to trick someone at McDonald's, because the entire job can be learned at home. There is no hidden knowledge. The full ""instructions manual"" is available online. It is called ""e-learning""  Minimum wages are rising in Western countries. UK is up to £9.50 an hour now. Parts of the US are now $15 an hour.  People with autism often like to do the same thing again and again forever. The term I often see is, ""restricted repetitive behaviour""  The job itself is ultra repetitive. But the job will also likely be around forever. I am highly skeptical that the job will be automated by robots. Robots have been clever enough to automate this for decades. It has nothing to do with technological progress needed. Something else is holding back automation. Perhaps floor space restraints. Perhaps the fear that one ""glitch"" will permanently lose the store its customers. Perhaps social rebellion or revolution if millions are made unemployed. Most people won't be happy to collect welfare or Universal Basic Income or bullshit like that. McDonald's may well just be stuck in a hostage situation where people just will block them with their automation bullshit. Social violence etc. You can't just jail everyone. There is nothing ""true"" about money at all. If enough people say ""no"" to automation, McDonald's will cave in. Again, the fact that it's 2021 and no automation of McDonald's, tells me that they are probably too scared to do it.  Ok, cleaning. McDonald's manager will try to trick you into signing up for a cleaning shift. It's not an honest job at all. It's the kind of thing where you clean it perfectly well, and some dickhead manager still says you didn't clean it. Then they harass you into cleaning every last missed spot. Don't get tricked into the overnight or evening cleaning shift. The morning cleaning shift works better.  Hours. These restaurants have long hours, and are often open 24 hours. If anything you will get more hours rather than less. If you are getting tired, be assertive and tell them to give you less hours. The store, remember, is far more desperate to hire you. Hence, they are paying some people now, to show up for interviews.  The job involves exercise. Music is constantly playing in the background. It gives you some social interaction, because you are surrounded by people, whereas we are often ignored or rejected in school or other workplaces or social clubs. These people are forced to be around you. You get to overhear their conversations.  I learned quite a lot about how women socialise and think, just by working a job at McDonald's. The job is often female dominated. They work this job due to the early and late hours allowing them to pick up their children from school etc. It's a good place to learn socialising.  I personally had little to no interaction with females when I was at school. All of my friends were male. And we basically just played video games or sports and didn't really do ""proper"" socialising.  I found that McDonald's is almost like going back to school, in a weird way. And this time, you are hanging around the girls. Even the men at McDonald's, and they are often more sporty or athletic types, due to the physical nature of the job. So in that regard, it's almost like if you went back to school, and the ""cool kids"" were forced to hang around you.  I really do feel like I learned a lot socially here. I worked the job in my late 20s. But often the workers were 16, 17, 18 year olds who were still finishing up high school. I was personally rejected almost entirely socially, by the time I got to that age at my high school. So it's almost like re-doing school and this time you get included.  In mental health therapy, there is a concept called ""exposure Therapy"". I think something happens along these lines while working at a McDonald's. It's like being included by all the kids who would have otherwise excluded you at school. Really weird.  Other than that, the job gets you exercise. You cannot eat while working the shift. Only while on your break, which lasts 30 to 45 mins. This forces you to basically ""get in shape"" and even lose weight. I lost weight while working the job. If you ate something like vegan or keto fasting, while working the job, rather than eating the actual McDonald's food, I'm sure you would lose even more weight.  The job involves timers on every screen. This forces you to do the job quickly, and makes it somewhat like a job, that is converted into ""video game format"". This is what Russell Barkley says helps for ADHD. To convert the job into a video game, with ticking down timers, rewards, consequences, points etc.  The job pays you by the minute that you are clocked in. Hence, it is a highly ""honest"" job, in that regard. You are paid for precisely the work that you do. I personally find it very hard to understand typical professional office jobs, where apparently most neurotypicals are barely doing 3 hours of productive work per day, and spend the rest of the time enforcing social rules and structures.  The job involves being highly tuned-in to your sensory environment. You have to listen out for colleagues, customers, cooking machines bleeping with sounds.  Some workers I observed, were seemingly deliberately pretending not to hear instructions from managers or even customers. This is clever because remember, this how school bullying or ""spam email"" works. They can keep sending you ""spam instructions"" or ""spam problems"", and if you keep listening out for every little ""spam request"" from them, you are now looking like a gullible ""slave"" who will respond to everything anyone says to you. Thus they deliberately bully you by wasting your time with constant new invented fake crises.  I personally did not train up to be promoted to manager. The reason, is because with autism, I am better at the repetitive aspect of the job, being like an ultra athlete and just responding ultra-quickly to the instructions on-screen or listening out for this and that going wrong. I also wouldn't bother with manager because it usually only pays like £1 or $1 extra per hour.  I also wouldn't bother with manager, because there are some real narcissistic psychopaths working at McDonald's  ""Chef"" is listed on psychiatry websites as a ""top 10 jobs that psychopaths work""  The reason why, is that psychopaths suffer from much the same ""object permanence"" problems as ""autism"" and ""ADHD"". They enter the restaurant and seemingly forget that an outside world even exists. They then turn on the colleagues like it's a boxing cage match, or a prison. You are ""walled in"" with them, and thus, it's ""us versus them"" rather than an ""expanding pie"" concept. It's a bit like if the McDonald's store was a video game, and the walls of this store are the outer walls in a video game level map. There is literally nothing outside of this ""video game map"". These are the ""outer edges""  I once saw a manager who was so psychopathic, that he was asking people if they wanted to be manager, just to ""smack them around"", ""make life hard for them"", and thus, they quit the job entirely. Not even quit just as manager and demoted back to regular worker. But literally quit the job altogether.  I know this sounds funny, but there really are some psychopaths working for McDonald's. Very strange and very funny phenomenon.  Other than that, just give it a try!"

joost666,7,"I just don't want to ever have psychological or physical pain. Fate often does not really allow that. So, then I try to control things, try to avoid it all. However, that creates more or different pain.  I don't want to work for example, because working more days than you are free doesn't make sense to me. It is a modern form of slavery to me (doing more than you get back) : psychological pain.  But, me trying to do as less as possible at school (fulltime program)  gives the result that I learn less and  that I never get used to the fulltime work I have to do when doing an obligatory internship: more and different pain.   Other example: I don't want to meet new people. So, I never do. I try to avoid possible pain. But when I have to, for a future job interview for example, I will get really anxious == pain. So, then I might procrastinate endlessly and get more pain: maybe I will have financial problems or I will have to stay with parents that are too old for me to be there.   How do you have the strenght to not avoid the pain? How to accept the world as it is and not let it limit you?"

It's only recently since starting eye drops that dilate my pupil to over expose the image to mask the shadow from the black speck in my eye, that I can function somewhat. But I've also realized what I've lost. I used to love to just look at details of everything. Now I can't do that anymore, because I never know when the disturbance will enter my eye, and thus I can never relax.  It's been and is incredibly debilitating. That one place I could always find peace, in the details of things, have been lost.   I could get surgery to replace the entire vitreous of my eye, but trying to get a doctor to understand how this is affecting me due to my autistic brain being so wired for visual optimization, is gonna be hugely difficult.  And all my other sensitivties are super heightened because my brain is basically overburdened from the minute I open my eyes.  What should I do? I don't know how much longer I can live like this without mental peace."
MycologistAdvanced24,43,Does anyone else overreact if you are frustrated with a poor performance. If I dont do well in my sport team i become angry with myself often visibly to others. I have to then spend time on my own.

joost666,7,"I am constantly stressed because things don't stay the same. I wish I would know the outcome of every future situation, so I don't have to worry about anything again. I don't want a challenge in life. I want to be comfortable. I have been uncomfortable all my life long.   There are possible risks everywhere.   There is risk in how people might react to what I say. I can't read their mind though.   there is risk in getting a insufficient grade and having to do a resit, which leaves less time for the other subjects.  There is risk I can't say what I have to say because conversations expect me to answer directly. I often miss a lot that I actually should say, even if I prepare.   There is sometimes a risk I come late to a class because the train is delayed.  There is a risk that I don't estimate time correctly and I miss the train. (Even though I know I won't, I am still anxious about it.)   There is a risk that new people will find me weird. Or that I cannot communicate effectively with them.   In summer I don't ever want to go outside because of wasps.   I don't ever want to go on vacation/do something outside of the house because that also stresses me out.   And more..   I wish we could all use one perfect agreed upon communication medium that does not rely on instant response. Talking is a bad way of communicating for me. All other people seem to think that it is really the best way, but I just lose the big picture.   I also wish there would be no consequences of when some risks become truth, so I wouldn't have to worry:   So what that I have an insufficient grade? , just let me pass. I can always look stuff up later when I need it. I don't need to cram it now. I will forget anyway! I won't forget that the subjects exists though, so no problems. But schools don't understand this. The tests are unrealistic. They don't simulate the real world."

AspiringBiotech,6,"Where are our future Noam Chomskys? Our future Carl Sagans? Where are the eloquent, original-thinking, creative, non-conformist geniuses who inspire millions via well-reasoned analyses to educate themselves, grow as people, think outside the box, change the world, etc? Can such people be the product of a society which largely doesn’t read and which is, therefore, largely incapable of comprehending complexity or nuance?  I recall the sense of awe I’d felt listening to Chomsky extrapolate meaning from various sources which others had neglected to study. I remember the deep admiration I had for his well-formulated, air-tight responses to ignorant claims made by debate opponents who obviously hadn’t done their homework. He would say, basically, “you’re wrong…and now I’m going to explain to you WHY you’re wrong” and would give numerous examples utilizing pertinent statistics, point out contradictions made, describe which logical fallacies were used, quote philosophical treatises, cite relevant historical data, and so on, until no doubt was left in the mind of a reasonable person that he knew exactly what he was talking about and had won the argument at hand.  Today, what I hear from “public intellectuals” is “you’re wrong…here’s a list of widely known facts people have read on Facebook and or Wikipedia…here’s a reference to a popular meme…here’s a weakly formulated argument that only touches upon a few of the things you mentioned…”  It’s tragic. It’s dangerous."

Ofcourse there is some free time, but the time not being free is way more and also depletes energy for when you do have free time.  I want to play games and piano, but after working on college asignments, I don't have the energy to do that. The only thing I result to is watching Netflix, because that doesn't take energy."
joost666,7,"With every asignment at school, I want to be done with it as soon as possible and when done, I am comfortable again. This eats up my energy, especially with big asignments.   The reason I do this is fear.  I cannot afford te risk of not meeting the deadline: a resit takes up time I need for the next semester, failing the resit means having to do it the next year.  I don't understand why the system is build like that. If  I want to learn something, It is better to just let me learn it properly, without a deadline and until I have really mastererd it. They don't give you time for such things. How can I be good at the subject then?  Becoming a software engineer takes practice, but they don't give you the time to practice.

foooood4thought,13,"I am starting to wonder, if ""touch"" is the most under-rated sensory issue, in all  of autism.  As a child, there was a certain shirt in my clothes drawer. And I would hesitate to touch it. I would massively hesitate to touch it. I would actually make visibly revolted facial expressions, even leading up to the anticipation of touching it.  Eventually, I ""manned up"" and touched this shirt.  But see, the problem is, we are very delicate people, and I think that we choose tasks on forms of extreme perfectionism and selection, subconsciously.  So the problem is, even if I got over my most extreme fear of touching this shirt, how about subconsciously though?  Have you ever considered, that the reason we are unproductive with autism, is due to phobia of touching certain fabrics?  It is well documented, that autistic kids can refuse certain foods, due to the textures of the foods.  It is well documented that many autistic people choose to wear precisely the same clothes every day.  It is well documented that autistic people can dislike being touched, or hugged.  And we know, that EVERY human productive action in the world, unless you have a Stephen Hawking style machine, is done with your HANDS!  Is this the biggest unrealised truth about autism? TOUCH PHOBIA  If you have a phobia of touching certain fabrics, and all human productivity involves using the hands, then is this the REAL reason that we cannot be productive?!  Consider, that if you wore a pair of gloves all day long, that you have now created a mono sensory filter for every given thing that you touch.  If you were OK with the plastic feeling of your gloves, then it becomes irrelevant which things you touch in the external world, because they are all being filtered through these gloves!  For example you touch wood, but it just feels like your plastic gloves.  You touch a cardboard box, but it just feels like your plastic gloves.  You pick up a leather wallet, or a cotton wallet, or a wallet made of wool, but it all becomes irrelevant, because it's all going to be filtered through your gloves!  I noticed something very, very strange in my life.   I often am the most productive in life, right around November, going into December, going into January, and where I live, in the UK, these are some of the coldest months of the year.  I often do things like, apply for a job that I was procrastinating on or not even thinking about, and apply for this job in the coldest months of the year.  Some of this may be to do with a separate sensory issue of light sensitivity, and of course, consider that things like ""dry eye syndrome"" is actually also a touch issue, as much as it can involve light sensitivity. You feel the grit against your eyes, and this will be less so in the cooler months of the year.  But think about it. If the weather is cold, what does this mean?  If the weather is cold, your hands basically go numb, or at least, they go more numb.  Furthermore, I have a history, all throughout my life, of sitting on my hands while on chairs. And what is the result of this? My hands temporarily go numb.  What happens, when your hands go numb? It means that you cannot feel things as sensitively. This is effectively a way of turning off, or turning down, your touch sensitivity.  It's just too weird.  An added bonus of course. In winter months, not only do your hands go cold, thus, reducing touch sensory issue.  But, you might also then put on a pair of gloves, because it is cold. So then you have a further benefit of turning all touch issues into mono touch, rather than phobia of particular surfaces.  Again, the key point here, is that this is VERY SUBTLE.  As in, as a child, I once had a HUGE phobia of a certain shirt.  But, as an adult, this phobia is probably still there, but just toned down.  As in, my brain is very likely, choosing which activities I do, based on which surfaces are involved in touching.  It goes deeper still.  What are autistic people often doing? Addicted to the Internet? Addicted to video games?  I have spent enormous portions of my adult life, both unemployed, and also, spending nearly all damn day on the computer.  And what can we say, in this regard? That I am touching the same surface all day, the same keyboard and mouse. I am in fact, filtering the world, through the computer, and through the consistent touch texture of the keyboard and mouse.  A keyboard and mouse is basically a plastic-y type surface, isn't it? Metallic soemwhat. Depends on who makes your computer.  Then consider also, that the computer has everything you need, visibly on the computer screen, as opposed to say, leaving the house, because I literally cannot see the front door of the house, if I am not in the same room!  So just imagine a simple combination here, of being more ""used to"" touching the keyboard, and then, in an object permanence sense, not being able to see the front door. And this alone can explain why we sit on the computer all day unemployed!  I am starting to wonder if TOUCH is the most under-rated sensory issue in ALL OF AUTISM!"
PeteyZee1998,24,"Im a low functioning autist. I require daily care and supervision with certain tasks as I can cause myself accidental harm, eg not using the oven properly or starting a fire unintentionally . My iq is low as tested 3 times as being in the intellectual disabled range. I wish I could be more independent and not need supervision and could clean myself properly, I would take a cure for that but never for autism as I love my autism   Since following Instagram autism speaks page, I have read many stories they post of autism people, with an image of them. I don’t agree with their alleged cure approach as other people with autism say that AS tries to erase autism.   I don’t necessarily agree with trying to find solutions to severe autism, for example my small business owner friend is not able to work properly due to his severely non verbal autistic son interfering and trying to cause harm to the shop. I don’t disagree with finding him a type of solution."
SpektrumKid,2,There are some days when it becomes unquestionable that I’m autistic which I’ve been in denial about most of my life without even knowing it.   But forgiving myself for things I had no guilt in is the biggest load off my back in my life.   Try it if you can. You don’t need to feel so bad about being bad at certain things. Like regulating your emotions. Sometimes you’re just gonna feel things very strongly and may not know exactly what those feelings are. But that’s ok.   Your only job is just to exist as best as possible in each moment.
joost666,7,"Falling in love on first sight to me is like: being with/seeing someone makes me happy, but I wouldn't say that I care about that person. I would say instead that I want the feeling that she gives me. So, at the beginning I would just be selfish, I want the feeling, not her. I want her in my arms, even though I don't know her and don't care about her.   NT's see it differently. They seem to immediately say that they want to be with her. They see the feeling as the real truth. ""She is amazing, ai really like her"".  I see it as the best drug, that my body can produce. However, I cannot really care about her, because I don't really know her at the beginning. With friends, I have history , real moments. However, someone I fall in love with and don't know (that well) not."
SpektrumKid,2,"I usually don't see anyone, and when I really devote myself to being utterly alone for long stretches of time, it is as if I really rekindle a connection to my true self. Scary at first, but way better in the long run.   But then, when I start socializing again, I feel renewed in a weird way from interacting with people again, and noticing how all that changes my thinking, maybe for the better, or for the worse, I can't tell? But what I find is that people rub off on me so much (I soak in their personality and everything about them), that it seems to become at the expense of myself?   Can anyone relate to this? Today I spent an hour with one friend in the park, and yesterday I hung out with another friend who I've already seen twice this week (way over my normal 'allowance' of socialization)... so maybe it's because I'm super spent already socially, but coming home I feel like I'm exhausted and lost part of my identity, and all I can remember is parts about their lives and not my own?  Does our impressionable minds lose itself if too many impressions are to be digested?"
PeteyZee1998,24,"I fucking hate how normies enjoy “roasting” or simply belittling people as if they’re a cardboard box.  NTs will sometimes make long posts against bullying and get offended about constructive criticism, but at the same time say things like “look at the top of yo head”  A lot of influencers on Instagram make me angry too. A sports commentator had a heart attack, and some influencer said “smoking 2 packs and drinking 5 bottles of alcohol will do that to you”  With no evidence the victim does! And he got 50 likes!  That’s 50 people who are totally fine with acting like total arseholes to a man who suffered.   Yet we are labelled as lacking empathy, this world is not fair."

PeteyZee1998,24,"I’m caring, I can help others, I can respond critically fast to siblings emotions.   But beneath this mask of decency, I have a dark side that just wants to be worshipped, in control, be able to control people and manipulate them without feeling sorry.   I also have a deep resentment for the world and feel that secretly I’m so disadvantaged that It makes me so unique.   I have a dialogue with women on dating sites and that’s presenting myself as a super emotional guy who is an empath as well as compassionate, but my goal is control, submission and even a sense of sadism. I want to secretely hurt peoples emotions and find ways to acquire power and total superiority from them. I like the feeling of being emotionally abusive. When I had an online girlfriend I tried to convince her she was a schizophrenic for believing in such things against me, she was not a schizophrenic she had borderline pd.    I always deny things and try to gaslight people, I make complete random stories up and get a sense of excitement when they believe it.   I am a pathological liar.   This is under my caring nature and kindness I have towards my mom and strangers.   I don’t fake my emotions, I genuinely feel them.   I’m diagnosed with narcissistic traits, but a full diagnosis of level 2 autism spectrum disorder and a intellectual impairment evident by my late milestones and even by my inability to look after myself without a carer.   Most of the times these psychological traits are kept within and don’t come out very often. But they’re there   I don’t know why I’m like this, I don’t wanna be a bad person.

AutoModerator,26," **What Is Asperger's Syndrome?**  Asperger's Syndrome (AS), also known as High-Functioning Autism (HFA), is the old name for what is now generally called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Level 1. It is a neurological disorder characterised by a difficulty with communication, a lack of social awareness, unusual use of vocal and non-vocal language, a greater or lower sensitivity to one or more stimuli, and obsessive patterns of behaviour or activities. It is not uncommon for people with ASD to be bullied, marginalised, and generally discriminated against by neurotypicals (NT) for their unusual behaviour making it difficult to enter into friendships or relationships, leading to loneliness, depression, and suicide. The cause is currently suspected to be a mixture of genetic and environmental causes, though there's little evidence for any theory. All we know for sure is that ASD is lifelong and uncurbable, though therapy can help. For more information please visit the [FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/wiki/faq).  **Why Get A Diagnosis?**  An official diagnosis can help you understand yourself, your behaviours, and can rule out other conditions that often overlap with ASD but are treated differently. Examples include Depression, Social Anxiety, [Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)](http://hsperson.com/), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Social Communication Disorder (SCD), and a number of other disorders. For many a diagnosis is an answer to a lifelong question of why they felt so different.  It can also get you access to various support programs. In the UK you can receive [Personal Independence Payments](https://www.gov.uk/pip), several employers will guarantee an interview for applicants with disabilities including autism. You can gain special permissions, such as wearing shoes that are normally disallowed in a dress code or exemptions from performing certain types of work. Schools and universities can offer you more time to complete exams or access to tools and mentors to help with your learning.  **Should I Get A Diagnosis?**  Some people don't get a diagnosis for a variety of reasons, preferring instead to refer to themselves as self-diagnosed. Depending on where you live getting a diagnosis can be expensive, overly difficult, a great deal of hassle, or in some instances literally impossible. There are online tests that can indicate how likely you are to be on the spectrum, however they are not a substitute for an official diagnosis required to get access to the previously mentioned support programs.  * The [Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)](https://psychology-tools.com/autism-spectrum-quotient/). Scores above 32 on this 50-question test indicate a high probability of ASD. * The [Ritvo Autism Aspergers Diagnostic Scale-Revised](http://www.aspietests.org/userdetails.php?target=/raads/questions.php). Scores above 65 on this 80-Question test indicate a high probability of ASD. Much more accurate.  **How Do I Get A Diagnosis?**  A diagnosis will normally consist of several interviews with a professional who will observe your behaviour and ask a series of questions design to reveal your ways of thinking. These questions will be a mix, some about how you would behave in certain theoretical scenarios, other about life events and how you reacted to them. They will also ask about your current abilities and if you've demonstrated any others in the past. As previously stated, getting a diagnosis is often very difficult if not impossible, it depends entirely on where you live. Every option has a very long wait time, usually over a year.  In the UK:  * [The NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/getting-diagnosed/how-to-get-diagnosed/) has a page explaining the process.  In the US:  * [Autism Source](http://www.autismsource.org/) is a search engine for local resources. It provides options for filtering and services can be searched based on location. You will have to pay for most services. * [Autism Society](http://www.autism-society.org/) \- This society has local support groups that meet. Attending allows you to connect with others and discover resources in your area. There is a focus on parents with children but they are adding resources for adults as well. * [California Regional Centres](http://www.dds.ca.gov/RC/RCList.cfm) \- California has services for disabled people available at Regional Centres in the state. Services can include free diagnosis and supports after diagnosis. All ages are included. There can be a long wait time and it may require persistence. Services are not limited to autism.  Elsewhere in the world:  * Check with your national healthcare provider or talk with your doctor, they will normally be able to direct you in the right direction. * We want to provide as much country specific information as possible, if you can please let us know where people in your country should go for a diagnosis or support.  **I Have a Diagnosis, What Now?**  What you do with your diagnosis is entirely up to you. You can tell your friends and family or keep it to yourself, use it to get government assistance or accommodations made for you at work. A lot of people feel a sense of closure after acquiring theirs, others don't and continue to explore their neurology and mental state.  Be aware that when sharing your diagnosis people may change their attitude towards you, suddenly treating you more like a child or a freak. Others may outright deny that it's correct, declaring that there's nothing wrong with you or that you just want an excuse for being lazy. Family and friends alike distancing themselves after learning of a diagnosis is an unfortunately common horror story, unwilling to be associated with an autistic individual.  **Other Resources**  * [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) \- A central location for groups of all kinds and their meeting schedules. Search for autism in your area for a support group. You can find out a lot of information from other people dealing with autism. You can narrow the search for groups for young adults or teenagers. * [Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN)](http://autisticadvocacy.org/) \- A non-profit group run by autistic people for autistic people. They have chapters in the US and a few overseas.

For instance I absolutely will not eat my food around Halloween Decorations if it’s of a wet or gooey texture with liquids in it. Because for some reason it makes me feel gross when eating and looking around at those creepy looking decorations, so much so they’ve caused me to loose my appetite and refuse to eat in restaurants with decorations with them in October. Which I personally find odd as I have no problems with decorations for other holidays like Easter, Valentine’s Day, or thanksgiving/Christmas. Does anyone else have these issues?"
PeteyZee1998,24,"I’ve done and said shit and exhibited personality traits in keeping with the diagnostic criteria of narcissistic personality disorder, a lot when I was about 20, I’m 23 now.   I have this attitude of “people should stop being so weak, I sometimes resent those who show their emotions too much as being “soft”.   Toxic masculinity is not really a possibility because I openly express my emotions openly and dress androgynous and non binary at times.   I get angry at people who are sick, but at the same time if I feel abandonment is a possibility I immediately feel bad and sad, also if I see injustice that really pisses me off, I also hold deep concerns in serious circumstances and can deeply relate and feel the pain of others and can cry to things in limited circumstances. I still have a helping nature and a friendly tone with people and always have a sense of sympathy and understanding with certain people."

foooood4thought,13,"Let me ask you guys a workplace, employment question here, for autism, and maybe this is relevant to ADHD too, and many of us have both conditions.  What can you do in a workplace if you don't understand the instructions, communications?  The reason that I never attempt to work professional type jobs, degrees etc, is a communication problem.  I feel like, I mis-understand, for language, communication reasons, what the other people are saying.  As in, if we all had Aspergers, we would surely phrase these things, and explain these things, in a very different way.  For example, people with Aspergers, tend to phrase things in great detail, like a very well-written instruction manual, almost like writing out a flow chart of precisely what to do, where all the instructions are fully transparent.  And people with Aspergers tend to, take as long as it takes, to explain something to someone, often having much more patience than neurotypicals, and can be a really great teacher.  What I found, since leaving school at age 18, is that the real world doesn't work like this at all.  At school, we would spend years at a time, learning the textbook, learning the English literature book, highlighting it, going through it, giving us chances to even ask the teacher and students questions as we went along.  And as I hit the real world, it's like everything was fully inversed from that.  That is really the first big learning curve of ""the real world"". That no one is actually explaining things anymore.  We live in a competitive world where time is money, and thus, instructions and explanations really get watered down.  Furthermore, this all assumes, that people are even honest and genuine in the first place, when often, they are NOT.  For example, in many workplaces, colleagues will actually give you, deliberately bad explanations, deliberately lie to you.  A common workplace trick, is for a manager to use their superior knowledge of the work environment, as a trick against you. As in, they know the inner workings of the company better, because they have been working there longer.   Therefore, they can simply ""withhold"" information from you altogether, and use that to make you look ""slow"" and ""dumb"" in the job, and therefore, you end up getting fired, or demoted, or passed over for the promotion etc.  The workplace is in fact, like an ""anti-school"", where it's all about teaching people as little as possible, if not, just outright lying to you, to get you fired. It's a damn harsh world lol  For this very reason, I have avoided professional jobs altogether, and stuck to ""dumb"" jobs where I can fully and entirely reseach the job ahead of time, jobs that are fully transparent to where it's basically impossible to play a workplace trick.   I have chosen jobs where you can fully ""pre-learn"" the job at home, to avoid such lousy communication with shitty colleagues in the workplace.  Jobs such as, restaurants, delivery driver, factories. Just really damn simple jobs, and clearly, as a result of this, I end up making less money than I would in more professional jobs. Not to mention, these jobs are more physically exhausting and strenuous on the body, you end up being more fatigued etc.  In these types of jobs, there is even a higher risk of injury, such as workplace injury, not to mention, during coronavirus, there is a greater risk of catching coronavirus in such jobs, because you cannot ""work from home"" at a restaurant.  **Do you guys have any tips in this regard? What, if anything, can be done, to help us communicate and ""learn the job"", in more complex, evolving jobs, where you can't just ""look it all up in advance on the website""?**  **Is there anything that can be done here, or are we just stuck in ""dumb jobs"" for life?**"

AspiringBiotech,6,"I mean, I enjoy reading a lot on my own time. I take notes on various subjects ranging from Ornithology to Retail History to Anthropology on a daily basis. None of this is school-related. This never feels burdensome. It never feels like work. It’s pure fun. I read, mark the most important and interesting facts, and retain nearly everything.   On the other hand, the majority of college courses I’ve taken over the years (and I’ve taken many as I’ve been a student for over 10 years now) have been a struggle. The Zoology classes I loved involved rote memorization of hundreds of facts a week. In itself, that’s not too bad but combined with 2-4 other classes requiring the same or nearly the same level of study, it’s simply overwhelming. Most people are incapable of retaining the thousands and thousands of facts they’ve “learned” in college. I know. I’ve asked former students. I understand that “learning how to learn” is important too and that research and critical thinking skills are often employed by professors; yet learning to separate the wheat from the chaff is also of value. You can’t know it all and must therefore choose what to hold onto skillfully.   I currently only take 1-2 courses at a time and I’m able to keep up quite well. I recommend doing the same."
PeteyZee1998,24,I’m level 2 asd but it’s only noticeable in my one sided conversations occasionally or when I simply need to perform tasks and even self care. So when I struggle with that people think I’m lazy not impaired.
PotentialAgile951,4,I know what you are thinking of course it is. But wait just a second let me explain. You see I mean when people call me one but doing it more of a joke than actually to be mean. But you see this people don't know I'm autistic and I feel like people already treat me like a reatard. So I get super offended when people call me one because I don't know if they actually believe it are not. But I'm not a mean person so I'm not going to say anything to them. I'll probably just cry about it later but there never know it offended me. And the worst part is I take it so personal and it really hurts my feeling. Maybe I'm just a cry baby. So is it stupid are not?
PotentialAgile951,4,I'm 18 never been on a date. But I'm worried if they hear my speech impairment. They might not want to try. does me sounding like a nine-year-old make me less attractive.
joost666,7,"My comfort-zone is sitting at home playing videogames, watching series, playing music and learning my own things.  Then college comes with all these things that's just so far away from this comfortzone: doing obligatory internships, giving us too much work, forcing us to present( even though my brain does not process information lineair like that) and also sometimes giving us no other choice but to do work in the weekends.   How do I get through this? After graduation I will work part-time, but before that, I need to get through all this. It means that I first have to be unhappy, instead of motivated to learn and then I can be free and happy again.  I  cannot be 5 days of the week 9 - 5 unhappy. I withdraw into escapism at night and am tired the next day because of it."
PeteyZee1998,24," Neurodiversity tends to focus and only praises and showcases the benefits of autism which is great and unique, but it Dosent show the fact how many autistic males like me are lower functioning and need daily assistance to function including bathroom and self care, it’s a condition I wouldn’t cure because I accept myself but I’m not gonna pretend I don’t suffer hardly from it. It’s the root of almost all of my problems. Being level 2 is very hard to cope with,. It’s harder to make friends and more sensitive to overload. And it causes behavioural issues such as aggression and very difficult problems.   Most of my problematic behaviour actually was never diagnosed as a personality disorder but due to my complex intellectual disability and lower functioning Autism which causes cluster b traits.  Level 2 means I can still socialise like my aspies but I tend to be very limited in my speech and only focus on my end of things and often seem very unaware of emotions and how rude I can be unintentionally"
foooood4thought,13,"The human brain does not do things based on words.  You can write out a diary on your computer, with a bunch of words, and you can write out your strategy with these words.  But when it comes to actually DOING the thing, in the REAL WORLD, there are no words involved.  The human brain is capable of storing 7 things in its working memory, i.e. RAM.  You need to clearly identify in your brain, that WORDS are for strategy, observation, fun, interests, cool. Nothing wrong with words.  I have written big long diaries every day for the last 9 years, alongside reading massive amounts of URLs on the Internet, and a few books here or there. 1,000s of YouTube ""recommended"" videos.  That's all great. But all of these things, are OBSERVATIONS. These are all formulas.  Do you understand?  If you were to write out a strategy on your computer, this would be the equivalent of the ""barriers"" in a race car track.  But the barriers themselves are not the ""work"". If you just put up barriers all day, and constructed your race track, but someone needs to actually race along this track.  The racing along this track, this is ""work"".  As you are racing along this track, you don't need to constantly re-design the track, as you are racing along. That would take far too much mental effort, if you had to re-design the race track, second by second, as you are racing along it.  In other words, this activity of identifying that the race track is correct, this should have already been done, before you started racing through the track.  Do you understand what I am saying here?  The autistic person is like a person who starts racing around a track, but then gets off to a bad start, believes that something is ""unfair about the rules"", ""unfair about the race track design"", and then demands a re-start of the race. They demand that the race be restarted.   If you take this mentality far enough, you will never start the race in the first place, because there is literally no limitation on how deep you can go into ""checking"" behaviour.   You could say that the first 1 second of the race was unfair.   You could say the first 0.1 seconds were unfair.   You could say the first 0.01 seconds were unfair  You could say the first 0.001 seconds were unfair  There is no limitation.  The way it works is, you construct the race, you say that this is good enough, and then you race through the damn track.  The human working memory can only hold 7 things at once. This is just about enough memory, to basically steer this vehicle without crashing. Once you start this race, you are either racing, or you are not. There is no time for clever tricks in the middle.  This is precisely what autism is, and precisely how autism works.  To be productive with autism, you are constructing a race track, purely for yourself, purely based on your own rules, and you are racing through it.  It has to comply with the rules of society, such as, follow the law, regulations, you need to have enough money to pay to rent out the racing facility for the day, to buy the barriers, etc, to rent out the go-karts.  But once the race track is built, it's built! There are infinite different ways that you could tweak this race car track. Infinite. You will NEVER finish constructing this race track, if you keep changing subtle little things. You have to just build it, finish it, and then race through it.  I suspect that autistic working memory actually contains significantly less than the 7 things most can hold. Our short-term memory is often highly impaired. We are very poor at adjusting to new situations, to new ""race car tracks"", to anything that is different or out of place.  An autistic activity that succeeds, is basically, that you set out 30 minutes for a race car track, and you race through it. I'm not even so sure that you can race against other cars on the track., because you are going to out of sync with them, crash into them, what if they don't follow the rules of the road themselves? It's too much. This is going to be more like a race car track that you rent out all for yourself that day, and you race through it, all by yourself, all alone.  Other people could be at this race car track. You could have some friends standing on the side and cheering you on. But they are to stand behind a clearly-defined line, and not to cross the line. If they cross the line, you stop racing the car, and you abandon the thing, and start again.  The autistic person, quite simply, is inversing ""designer"" with ""worker"".  The world that we live in, works on continual, ongoing dopamine release, which for many people, is tied to their jobs, but also their wives, families, even video games, etc.  So ""work"" is dopamine, and dopamine is ongoing needed. It is repetitive.   There is really little if any actual difference, of one race car track to another, of one golf course to another, of one smartphone to another.  There is a highly, highly limited role in this world, for the ""designer"".  Whereas there are massive numbers of jobs for the ""worker"".  So you need to design this race car track, as decently as you can, but to really cut this whole activity short, and get started doing the actual ""work"" of racing through this track again and again.  Plus, the best way to find out if anything is wrong with your race track, is to race through it for real. No one designs something correctly the first time, without glitches. No one writes computer code correctly the first time, without glitches.   The autistic unemployed unproductive person, is simply stuck in perpetual ""designer"" mode. They imagine on and on and on in more and more and more detail and perfectionism, and they never actually DO the thing. The autistic person is stuck in ""Schizoid"" mode, designing an ever-increasingly-complex race car track, on and on and on, and never actually racing through it."

joost666,7," I want to learn  in a comfortable efficient way: one step at a time until I get it right, remember it long term and are a total master in it.   College however wants too much done at once. So, I cannot really learn in a good way. It has to be done fast, because there are tests and deadlines. So, I learn with great stress and afterwards I don't remember much. My brain seems to erase the information because I didn't get the time and space to store the information long-term.   How do you really learn stuff if they don't give you the room for it? They don't even give me a lot of room to relax. Sometimes there is even work in the weekends."

foooood4thought,13,"OK, guys. I have autism. This is my theory on why we can't socialise...  Neurotypicals are identifying each other, using eye movements, using facial movements.  These are not precise numbers, but, let's say most people do 100 facial movements.  And then, let's say, autistic people only do 10 facial movements.  Therefore, it's like Face ID on Apple, and notice how Apple has added in more of these ""dots"" onto their Face ID, to make it more and more accurate.  There is actually a mental condition, I forget the name, where people think their own wife has been replaced with a fake wife.  They believe their own mother has been replaced with a fake mother.  How does a human being actually identify another human being anyway?  Smell? You can fake that with perfume?  Face? You can fake that with a disguise, just ask the CIA.  Walking patterns? Much harder, if not impossible, to fake. I watched a BBC documentary years ago, on how CCTV cameras identify people with walking patterns.  Dialogue? Ah! Now, you ""could"" identify someone, by quizzing them on their entire life story, every time you meet them. But that would take hours upon hours upon hours. This may even be why Aspergers talk at length on and on, this is our form of identifying each other.  But clearly, we only have 24 hours in a day, so we cannot possibly expect to socialise if we are talking at such length!  In the early months of our life as a baby, we failed to make proper facial and eye contact with our own mothers. This is the basis of a new treatment for autism that has been developed. They re-train mothers to make proper eye contact and then autism is apparently prevented. This was in the news recently.  How about new room concept? Autistic people, if one small thing changes in the room, believe that it's an entirely new room. Apparently this is why we get so startled by new situations. This is why we are overwhelmed at an airport with 100s of people walking around. This is why we are overwhelmed driving a car or a bike, with 100s of cars on the road, and all the different sounds etc.  I have a really strange feeling here, that we cannot socialise, because we are not even convinced that it's the same person in the room.  The autistic brain has actually been said to almost ""blank out"" other people in the room altogether. Subconsciously, it's like we almost don't believe there ARE any people in the room. Or that we are ""shape shifting"" throughout ""parallel universes"", and different humans are entering the room every split second.   It's as if we cannot talk to these humans, because we think that every second, it's actually a different human in the room altogether. It would be pointless starting a conversation with a person, if they are a new person every second?  Oh yeah, fun extra. I actually have anosmia, as one of my ""sensory issues"". I literally have no sense of smell whatsoever. So I can't use smell whatsoever to identify people.  Is it really an identification issue?  And if so, what would the solution be?  Autistic people are said to be like 24/7 ""workers"". We see others as ""colleagues"" rather than ""friends""  We talk to people for ""specific purposes"", like ""do this particular thing"", rather than, ""let's just hang out""  We suck at ""small talk"", and again, would take to you only for a pre-approved, ""white listed"" task.  Perhaps the solution for autism, is that we must basically pre-arrange each activity with a person, and then carry it out.  We also seem to entirely suck at ""interactive"", ""two-way"" conversation. We need ""one-way"" everything.  We are really just no different from a video tape, that plays from start to finish, and that's why we HATE being interrupted.  I feel like our conversation in autism, is more like, we rant at you for 30 minutes solid, you record it with an audio recorder, you go away and analyse what I've just said to you, and then you come back, with a 30 minute rant at me. And we go back and forth.  It's almost like chess players, playing this long-term chess game, where they might come back, once a week, to make a new move on the board.  This ongoing, day-to-day, two-way conversation, it just doesn't work, and leads to shouting and argument with us.  We are ridiculously slow to interpret new situations. This is why in jobs, we are best doing pre-arranged jobs which we can entirely ""pre-rehearse"", such as, learning the items on a menu, before applying to the restaurant.  Such as, being an actor in a play, and learning our lines, before showing up on stage.  And I also feel like, when we do get interrupted, that we should immediately ""throw in the towel"", and start the task all over again.  The way that we socialise, I believe, is entirely one-directional. This is not my theory. I have read this from proper sources. Autism is similar to ADHD, even narcissistic disorder, in this regard, in these long-winded, one-directional conversations.  I really do feel that, we should have one single rule for conversation, which is that, we have pre-defined, in minutes, how long I am going to talk to you. And then, if you interrupt me at all, that I will simply ""eject altogether"", and abandon the entire conversation.  For example, if you were in a school classroom, and one kid is calling you names, and you can hear it behind your back, with your exceptional autistic hearing, in your ears.  OK, and then, let's say, this kid at school, and he spreads rumours to the other kids, that you are a loser, and now you have 2, 3, 4, 5 kids all making fun of you, behind your back.  OK, so what is the solution here? The solution, is to leave the school classroom altogether, and not come back, until everyone stops making fun of you. You cannot do the autistic rage thing where you get angrier and angrier, and then start attacking the kids.   The solution to any and all school bullying, by the way, is to do what I just said. To literally leave the entire classroom.  Imagine if you were browsing through your files in Windows File Explorer. And you were going into a folder, and there are like 100s of files and sub-folders, and it's all so complex. And you just said, screw it, let's go back up. So you press the ""up"" arrow in your file explorer, and you ""escape"" the entire folder directory altogether.  OK, so that is what we are supposed to do, with autism and socialising.  We entered this folder, to find one specific file, and if we go 5 minutes and can't find it, and now we're forgetting why we even entered this folder at all, OK, so now we just abort the entire thing. Press ""up"", go back up to the directory ""root"" above this folder, stop what you are doing, re-collect your thoughts, and when you are ready, go back in again.  Have you ever programmed computers?  If you make just ONE error in the computer code, the entire code aborts.  You will spend the next, God damn, I don't know, 15 minutes, just looking for some semicolon that you put in the wrong place, or bracket or something.  That is autism. If we find one thing that surprises us, we really, in my opinion, have little to no ""thinking skills on the spot"", to figure out, ""on the spot"", how to correct this error.  We are, in my view, like computer code, where if there is one error, it just won't compile at all.  We are like people, if we are running a running race, and we must always come in first place. And if we are getting behind, and it looks like we have lost the race, that we just throw a tantrum, and want to restart the race all over again.  There is absolutely no point whatsoever, in telling yourself, that this is a ""bad thing"" and we should ""change our behaviour to become more like neurotypicals"".  No, no. This way of thinking is so deeply embedded in us.   I have seen autistic people married to each other in a relationship, long-term, and it is just miserable, long-term fighting, bickering, arguing, every day. The two people tug on each other, and they prevent each other doing anything without the other person's permission. They take every single attempt at breaching out into the world, and tug it down, parasitically stick to it, cling to it, hold it down, slow you down. It makes it impossible to be productive.  It doesn't so much resemble a relationship, as more like a battle in an arena. It's like the couple have gone off into their own Schizoid world, where in Schizoid Personality Disorder, it's just you, your very best friend/wife, and then the rest of the world is ""blockaded out"".   This is basically very dangerous, like domestic abuse, and once the relationship inevitably fails and you finally leave, it's like, you've gone decades now with no money or work skills etc.  Quite simply, the solution to autistic socialising, is to compartmentalise everything you do. Everything is just its own little thing.   Every interaction with your wife should be like a 30-minute pre-approved video tape that plays back. You pre-schedule it, you show up on time, a bit like a psychiatry webcam appointment or something.  We just don't do this sporadic, unplanned, co-operative behaviour at all. We need to be told what to do, or tell someone else what to do. But we are remarkably bad at this ""interactive"" social behaviour."

Just give me a part-time job that is a means to an end: earning money to be able to live. Then when I have the money I go and enjoy life.   A job should not be your life purpose, but many people treat it that way. ""What do you want to be when you grow up? ""is commonly asked to children. With this question you are already conditioning kids into thinking that being something is your life's purpose, that doing fun things doesn't matter that much and the 40 hour 9-5 grind matters most. They see that as normal and nothing else. Well I cannot handle working that much because of low energy and different priorities: being happy.   They should ask instead : ""what things do you want to do now and when you are older? “."

foooood4thought,13,"Guys. My productivity went up enormously, from simply not using a laptop, on my lap.  The screen is jerking itself up and down, and this impairs our concentration span.  Instead, take the laptop, plug it into an external monitor or big-screen TV, and use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.  I really do believe, with autism, you should never, ever use a laptop, or moving screen, of any kind.  I literally cannot even believe the productivity improvements, from using an external monitor, which is fixed to the table, and lines up with my eye height. I actually cannot even believe how well this has worked.  This doesn't even mention, that we possibly have sensory issues, from the weight of it, resting on our legs, or the heat of it, resting on our legs.  The next issue is, something called ""orthostatic intolerance"". Many people with autism also have, POTS, or they have, standing low blood pressure.   It means, when you are sitting upright, or standing upright, your blood pressure, or heart rate changes, and this also impairs your attention span.  So I also find, when using this external monitor, that it helps to basically lay almost flat, maybe 45 degrees, on a bed, supporting your back. Sitting upright for too long might be a problem."
joost666,7,"Their believes, ways of thinking of how things should be done makes the world difficult for us. I'm talking about people that created how schools and jobs and society in general work.    I wish we could change it around and only keep the people that don't make it difficult for us. I wish we could redefine the rules so living is not a scam anymore, so that everything is fair."

PeteyZee1998,24,"i am starting to feel a crippling sense of hatred for my mother who self diagnosed with CPTSD, all she complains about is her chronic insomnia, and when she wakes up is so super grumpy and toxic, being autistic i am prone to sensory overload, and the overload of her stomping, as well as complaining, makes me want to scream ''stop it STOP THE NOISE, GO AWAY'' and i wanna block my ears."
foooood4thought,13,"Guys. I want to save you a lot of time here.  I have ADHD. I have autism. I have dyspraxia.  These are 3 of the big ""hidden disabilities"", i.e. we are too ""clever"" to be seen as ""disabled""  Instead, people accuse us of being ""lazy"", ""arrogant"", ""try harder to pay attention"", ""go get a job, you bum"" type of stuff  Look. If you have any of these 3 conditions, your SHORT-TERM, WORKING MEMORY is impaired.  Imagine if the average person could hold 7 things in their working memory.  It's quite possible that maybe we can hold 3 things, 2 things, 4 things. I don't know precisely how many.  We are, quite simply, a ""low RAM computer"".  If you are a ""low RAM computer"", you are never going to be able to ""work things out quickly on the spot"".  If you try to ""work things out in advance"", this is like, when a computer runs out of RAM, and it transfers memory back and forth from the hard drive, and notice how slow that is?  Have you ever seen this on your computer? When it runs out of RAM? Then it uses hard drive as RAM. Then it's really slow? Yeah, that's us.  Guys. Our strength with autism, is that we have a great, phenomenal LONG-TERM memory.  OK. But here is the problem. If we are stuck in ""observer"" mode, then we never get the DOPAMINE that we need to get things done.  The way that dopamine works, is like a ""sugar high"".  You eat some sugar. You get a spike. But then it drops. Now you need to top it up with another high.  That is how sugar works, doesn't it?  And that is also how DOPAMINE works.  Interestingly enough, eating sugar actually literally boosts dopamine.  You know what else boosts dopamine? Doing things!  If we FAIL at something when doing it, we should then just try again.  OK, this can be hard in the workplace, because they fire you if you are too slow.  OK, so you practise the job at home. And set up your home just like the workplace. And then practise at home. Once again, though, don't think through HOW to do the job in ADVANCE. Instead, you JUST DO IT. By doing it, you learn where you are going wrong, and you improve.  To give a really simple example. If you ever worked at a McDonald's. They just literally put you on the restaurant and say ""do it"". There is basically no training. They just put you right into the busy restaurant right away, and just do it  What you are supposed to do at this McDonald's, is just do something. Just start by making the burger, even guess some ingredients. Making something is better than nothing. Just pick it up, by trial and error, as you go along.  They are never going to fire you at a McDonald's, because they are so desperate for staff. In some parts of the US, they are literally paying people to show up for a McDonald's interview! In Florida, paying people $50 just to show up!  Even if you can't be bothered to have a full shower. Just get in the shower, and wash just your back with the shower. Hence, even if you aren't perfect in washing your entire body, you at least washed some of it.  I suspect that we don't like all the turning and twisting, and fine motor movements in the shower. So, just stand in there and wash your back this time around. Next time, get in the shower and wash your front.  Not sure which job is the best one to work? Just pick the first one that sounds plausible!  Not sure which clothes to wear today? Just wear the first ones that fit.  Not sure which girl you want to approach for a date? Just pick the first one. If it fails, pick another one.  We are people, who, no matter how hard we try, we will ALWAYS screw it up the first time.  People with autism will ALWAYS screw it up the first time.  You WILL fail the first time.  Sure, once you learn a routine, you will now succeed each day, the first time you do it.  But how about before you learned that routine? You screwed it up the first time, didn't you?  The reason we cannot do things in autism, is because we are scared of failing the first time.  You will ALWAYS fail the first time.  How about talking to other people?  Have you noticed how, if you ask someone a question, many people just say ""no"" by default? They didn't even mean ""no"". They just do it instinctively.  You might as well ignore whether someone says ""yes"" or ""no"". They are equal to each other. You learn something either way.  You might as well ignore if you are feeling ""happy"" or ""sad"" today. Instead, ""happy"" and ""sad"" are exactly the same thing. Merge them and all them ""emotion"". And then, anything in between is ""non emotion"". Make it binary.  I am just saying, from my personal experience, that every time I try to THINK UP IN ADVANCE what to do, I get into ENDLESS PERFECTIONISM, ENDLESS CHECKING BEHAVIOUR, ENDLESS INDECISIVENESS.  But it's deeper than that.  Your brain has already detected that you are ridiculously indecisive.  Your brain has already detected everything that I just wrote.  Thus, even THINKING ABOUT thinking about things, is already making you anxious.  Your brain has already figured out that it sucks at thinking. Your brain knows that it needs ""trial and error"".  Even thinking about ""thinking about"", is making an endless anxiety loop.  Just do things. When you fail, and you WILL fail, it then goes into the long-term memory, which is actually what we are amazing at with autism.  Our brain is just a long-term database, chess brain, type thing. We do amazingly in this long-term thing here. We are simply building up, through failure, a long-term database of routines that work and don't.  Our autistic brain is seemingly nothing other than a database of long-term rehearsed routines.  It's like transferring an instruction from hard drive to RAM, and then it just runs.  The only way to interrupt an instruction in RAM, is basically to ""kill task"" altogether, or shut down the entire computer.  There is no ability to debate or change the actual task while it is in the process of running in RAM.  This is why we should just do things. Just do, do, do. We suck at thinking. Just do it."

No-Watercress-9116,10,"it seems to be an aspergers thing. i feel emotions for something. i normalize it over time. then i look for something else and the same thing happens. now very few things make me emotional.  i was too emotional. i would feel extremely sad for little things. i eould get very emotional if i wartch a movie.  then i tried to become ""stronger"" to get rid of the pain. but i also don't really feel happy. im not depressed or anything. i don't feel sympathy because (i really hate to say it) i don't care about other people anymore. i kinda intentionally developed this memtality. x person is in the hospital: ""oh thats unfortunate. hope they get out soon"" but i actually don't feel anything for them.  this also meant i don't enjoy movies as much, except for action scenes. extreme emotion triggers trigger my emotions but thats pretty much it. i took a break from tv shows for a year and when i came back i felt the emotions again but it was just for the first show then i stoped feeling it for the following shows. also im not enjoying music anymore and i couldn't get my enjoyment back.  i really don't like my current situation and im looking for ways to change it."

Competitive_Bid7071,16,"Personally speaking I’ve always felt sorta a connection to animals as a whole. I like my days often to have a scheduled routine of (waking up, eating, playing some games, using Reddit, eating again, going to my job, coming home to rest and relax, having dinner and desert, and finally going back to sleep.)   Animals also like eating certain foods over others which I also relate too personally speaking. Also there lives are just very simple and while I feel I would like a bigger role in something I’d like too not take up my routines I usually do in my day to day life. This has lead to me liking lots of characters in movies who are animals (not cartoons but actual animals) such as the Dinosaurs in documentaries.  Do any of you feel a similar way?"
Competitive_Bid7071,16,"Personally speaking I’ve seen some shows and movies that have had characters with Aspergers or autism in them some of which make it apart of the plot. Such as in Atypical or the movie rain-man which I watched in my human behavior class in school before graduating this year. Personally speaking there’s two characters in two animated shows I’m watching currently that I definitely do think have either autism or are on the spectrum in general. The first being Marcy from the show Amphibia she personally has displayed behavioral traits of both someone with autism and ADHD as she’s very smart and a logic based thinker, but she’s also extremely energetic and emotional at points which are signs that people with ADHD seem to have based on what I’ve studied. Plus she seems to struggle with eye contact which I also have struggled with when having conversations along with her being a talker which I can personally relate too.  The second character who I think is also on the spectrum is Luz from The Owl House I’ve heard many say she could have ADHD which I definitely think is very plausible. Considering she does display lots of behavioral traits that people with ADHD have such as being very energetic and have trouble with some social cues. Although she’s also very weird (in a good way) so I can’t feel if she’s just being weird or if it’s her ADHD that plays a large role in her personality causing others to think she’s weird. But yeah that’s been my experience so far."

SpektrumKid,2,"I've been beating myself up over the last 4 years from foolishly looking into the lens of a powered on laser, as it wasn't 'working' as I thought it would, thus hurting my eye, leaving a mark in my vision, possibly forever (or at least for a while until things clear up over time).  Have you done any such stupid things, where you realize later that maybe that was dumb?      Other examples of mine are:    Rushing across the street from nervous energy, sometimes a little too close to moving cars.   Getting a little bit too excited about opening a package with a pair of scissors. (Still haven't cut myself, luckily)  I'm trying to find out if this is relatable. Maybe I can stop being so down on myself for blaming myself for what happened and my injury."

SpektrumKid,2,"It's literally the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  I think it's the constant shame I felt for not being able to function like everyone else, and having to keep pretending it wasn't causing me severe distress to not let any of my emotional toll show.  4 years ago, the day before I got diagnosed, I accidentally injured my eye with a laser, and I notice it in everything I look at. A daily reminder of a moment of recklessness, with building stress and confusion, 40 years in the making.  Somehow, I deep down know I wouldn't have believed my autism diagnosis, had I not injured myself by a reckless stupid act. I have done many such acts of dangerous momentum without thinking, but somehow survived every time. I never connected it with autism or adhd, but damn is it connected to both.  Now forever on my actual hyper focus, will be reminded of the consequences of getting lost in that without thought. I will miss being able to fully immerse myself in details, as this visual reminder will always be there. But I reckon one day that I will become friends with my self sustained injury, and realize that it was the scar I needed to fully be able to embrace who I am. Limitations as well as strengths, and the limits of those strengths.  You can't find your true self, without sacrifice. Or at least, that's what I seemed to have learned so far. I stretched myself way too far, and it's a miracle something worse didn't happen. I could have become blind, or done something even more dangerous, without realizing what I was feeling and why.  It has been a true nightmare living a life as someone other than yourself, and coming out of it, is intense. It feels like a rebirth, but I'm the one delivering myself.  Does this make any sense to anyone, coming out of years of unconscious masking?  Here's a question: How do you forgive yourself for a mistake that you are gonna have to live with for the rest of your life?"

joost666,7,"We are really busy with school and sleeping enough would be a good idea, but I also really need to do a hobby to relax and escape and I can't do that enough , so my brain just resists everytime, making me sleep late and tired the next morning."
foooood4thought,13,"I had an interesting idea lately.  What if we simply lived for now, in our repetitive jobs, activities, loner life. Maybe go to a shopping centre or restaurant just to have people around us, to accumulate our brain to normal humans moving around us.  But then, Elon Musk says, autism ""cure"" in 5 years. Yeah, his timelines are nuts, but hey.  Fine. Let's say it's 10 years, 15, 20 until the cure. Maybe it's ""never"".  But have you considered the concept of a jigsaw puzzle?  If the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle didn't fit, would you attempt to jam them together? No, that would be stupid.  The evidence shows, that we are not INTERESTED in socialising.  The evidence shows, we are not GOOD at socialising.  The evidence shows, this is BECAUSE we fail to make the proper range of facial movements, incuding eye contact, but other more subtle body movements too.  The evidence shows, that the reason we can't make these facial movements, is because we failed to do so with our own mothers in the early months of baby development.  And, autism itself seems to be because neurons in the brain that most kids lose as they get older, we keep these extra receptors, and thus, we have constant sensory overload. Like a computer with far too much data coming in, and we are being overwhelmed with it.  The point is this.... should people, in general, do things that they are bad at?  Or should people stick to their strengths?  If you then consider, that socialising is a strain for us, then what happens when the difficulty of socialising increases? Then, the strain increases further still.  And we risk things like, overload, ""snapping"", not to sound stupid, but even, ""beating our wives"", ""getting arrested"", ""shouting"", ""domestic abuse"", etc.  We risk not just our own domestic abuse on others, but that others would do it to us.  Now imagine in contrast, something that we are much more natural at, such as, writing at length, talking to ourselves at length, doing Math (some of us), computer programming, artwork, working repetitive jobs, alone time.  So in fact, why would you overload your system with something you are bad at?  It's the equivalent of going to the gym, working out, and you can feel your muscles giving in, and yet you keep exercising, and then... pop! And you break a muscle, break a bone, etc. You have taken this beyond the ""breaking point"", and now you have ""snapped"".  So, my current plan is to have no social life, until the autism cure comes.  By the way, Neuralink from Elon Musk. He says this will be like a laser eye surgery procedure, that takes minutes.  If it takes minutes to CURE autism, it will take minutes to CAUSE autism.  Perhaps we can be given autism before work, to make us more productive at work, with hyper-focus.  And perhaps then, we can have autism taken away, when we get home in the evenings, so that we are better husbands, fathers, friends, social life etc.  It would be like ""autism on-demand""."

joost666,7,"All windows are open during a lecture because others want it  to be cool. However, cars pass by and I get focussing problems.  So, I close one window next to me. After a while some NT next to me asks his friend behind me if that friend could open it again, because it's getting warm.  All the other windows are still open dude! Why do you think I closed this one?  I just let it slide though.   Does anybody else have annoying situations as an Aspie?"
foooood4thought,13,"Hey guys. I have autism. Autism primarily is a ""social disorder"", perhaps above all else.   I don't believe we will ever replicate the full range of human facial expressions and do it naturally enough to ""pass as human"". Apparently this is because we didn't make proper eye contact with the mother in the first year of life as a baby.  However, maybe in public, we should just hide our face more often, to make up for the poor facial expressions. Or just openly tell people we have autism and thus ignore our facial expressions.  But putting that to the side...  The single most important thing I ever learned about socialising.  It has NOTHING to do with the words you are using.  It is ENTIRELY to do with the TIMINGS of the words you are using.  Or, put it this way. Before you go into the social arena, you should have already ""listened in"" and ""studied"" so many 1,000s of conversations, that you already know which words are appropriate and inappropriate to use, so that the words come naturally.  In other words, in any given social setting, you shouldn't be thinking through your words at all. You should already ""know what to do""  Let's say, you study for a school exam. You spend theoretically unlimited time studying for this school exam. But once you have studied for it, you are ready.   So then, once studying is finished, you go and ""do"" the exam. There is a time limit in school exams, say, 2 hours. Thus, when each question comes up in the exam, you actually have a very quick answer, ready to go. You are barely even thinking about the question, because you already ""rehearsed"" the answer.  In fact, the real key to passing an exam is  1. Going away and taking as much time as needed to learn the material before the exam 2. But then during the exam, doing the inverse, and answering the questions as quickly as possible, and with an overall time limit of 2 hours, versus no time limit in revising, and no time limit in learning.  OK, so we are dealing with a ""backbone"" of a long time limit, and then, ""short bursts"" of answering questions.  It is no different to doing an exercise workout, and you might intensively do 100 push-ups in the gym. Then, you take a breather for a few minutes. Then, you do 10 bench presses.  But prior to even going to the gym for the first time, you watch videos or watch others in the gym, doing these bench presses and exercises, to learn what they are at all, and even the longer you watch, you see the ways that these exercises can go wrong, and what to do in these situations.  OK, so, I believe, that socialising is exactly the same.  You go away, watch as much ""human"" interaction as possible. Note that this isn't just people talking, because people think it's creepy if you are listening to them, and might even alter their conversations as a result.   But even just, watch YouTube videos of people talking. Or, you know what we all did in school classrooms, of listening into conversations.  OK, but go back 100 years ago. 100 years ago, the average person was illiterate.  Human socialising has been developing for millions of years. And yet, human language is much newer.  How can socialising have anything to do with WORDS, if human beings were illiterate 100s of years ago?  How can socialising have anything to do with words, when cities are MULTI-LINGUAL, IMMIGRANT type cities? Notice how colleagues of different language all work and live together etc?  I have seen successful relationships, like dating, where it was a native English speaker girl, and the guy was an Indian who spoke very poor English, and somehow they were still dating.  This shows you just how little anything has to do with WORDS, and the accuracy of WORDS, and the precision and truth of WORDS.  It is quite the opposite, and people resent you and hate you for using TOO MANY WORDS.  IQ scores were ridiculously low even 100 years ago in America, compared to now. The average person in America, 100 years ago, I believe, was illiterate.  In fact, I think even now in Canada, currently 1/2 of all people are financially illiterate.  So what is going on here? Other than things like, insulting people, getting too easily offended, reacting too much to other people.... I don't see how socialising can possibly be about the particular words you are using.  Think about it like this as well.  Imagine if someone asked you a question casually, and you answered with a 10-minute rant. You are demonstrating a lack of self-discipline, in not being able to stop talking. You are taking up their time, which is intimidating to them. And if everyone were to answer questions like this, then there would be no time for productive work in our world, and thus, we would all be unemployed etc.  Take the thing that you are doing, imagine that everyone did it like that. Thus, we must give concise answers to things.  Furthermore, should we give answers to things at all? Narcissists actually think you are gullible, or even, controllable, if you actually give an honest answer to them at all.  What is the problem with giving an honest answer to someone's question? They could then just ""spam"" out questions all day long. You are then straining your brain to come up with the ""correct"" or ""thorough"" answer to their question. Overthinking, by the way, causes depression, or is linked to it, or you tend to overthink when in a depressive cycle. But how to break the cycle? By not overthinking.  Imagine if you answered every person's question honestly. But then, they could ask you a 2nd question, a 3rd question. They could even like, say, in an IT tech support perspective, kind of deliberately break the computer, just to make work for you, in fixing it. Do you see how they can ""wind you up"", here?  Ultimately, the correct place to obtain information, is actually from books, videos, articles, qualified doctors. The source of correct information is a central source that everyone reads.  So when you are individually answering people's questions, in a ""peer to peer"" perspective, you are actually just wasting everyone's time. That's not to say that you can't help people sometimes. But I often think that helping people should be someone just interjecting that into your life, rather than you asking, and then they answer. After all, if they help you without prompt it shows they have put in the effort into watching you, to see what you are doing wrong, to then help you. That shows that they are at least putting in effort here.  OK, here is another concept. Imagine if you were socialising with someone, who actually was deaf. What if they literally were deaf? Then, is this to say, we socially exclude everyone who is deaf? Or what if your best friend was hard on hearing, even if not entirely deaf? OK, so we are supposed to include people even if they are deaf.   Thus, this even further proves that socialising has less and less to do with the actual words!  Furthermore, the more words you use, the more words they are going to fail to hear. They will just skip and miss out words altogether.  The more complex it is what you are saying, the more of it they will misunderstand or misinterpret.  But do you see how it works? People with ADHD and autism are are often bullied. But people with ADHD + autism are known for being ""sensory sensitive"" and ""over-reacting"", or ""too quickly reacting"".   Sure enough, narcissists see you as an extension of their own body. Thus, when you react quickly, they see that as their cue that you are on their string. They have just ""invisibly"" controlled you. And then they will keep doing this.  If you react in a delayed way to someone, then that also gives you time to think as well. In the mean time, you could maybe do a social ""cue"" though, to at least demonstrate that you have heard them. Who knows?   But overall, I want you to think about timing here. it has to be about timing.  OK, now how about choice? Why do you believe that the FIRST person you ever meet, is going to be your best friend, or the first person you ever date, is going to be your wife eventually?  If you believed, the first person you ever met, will be ""the one"", then you are somehow a psychic, or the world's greatest pre-judger of people, to where every person you meet, is somehow the correct person, and you knew in advance, and it was all pre-planned, or in a paranoid sense, maybe they found you because they are a spy or God knows how mentally ill this can get, when you believe that the ""first"" person, must be the correct person.  Think about people who are stuck with their abusive families. Well, your mother is possibly the first person you ever bonded with. And yet, mothers can be abusive to their kids. They often are. Lots of autistic people fled their families and have no relationship with them.  So, imagine if you talked with loads of words, to each new person you met. Thus, the first person you ever met, you are talking to them 1 hour at a time back and forth.  This would therefore leave, no TIME left to talk and meet other people. Thus, the more you go on and on talking ot the same person, the more this person occupies ALL of your time, and the less time you have to ever meet other people!   It's like imagine time as a physical space, and you are pouring concrete into it, in liquid form, and it is setting and setting, and now there is no space left. You have occupied all the time takling to this one person, and the more you do this, the less time there is for other people. Thus, this one person BETTER BE the best person you ever met, because the way you are dong it with the timing, this is going to be the ONLY ONE.  So it's all about ""light touches"". it's all about ""short interactions"" with a person, followed by a break, followed by another ""light interaction""  Just like in a day job, you are doing 100s of micro-tasks a day. OK, so, you do one task. Then break. Then one task. Lots of micro tasks and micro breaks throughout the day!"
PotentialAgile951,4,I whould not know I'm 18 a guy I don't really care all that much about the sex thing are if they are sexy. I'm a vergin dose not really bother me though. But I think I would want someone to be emotional with just to see what that feels like.dose that sound stupid maybe I just need a therapist.
joost666,7,"I have strong principles/opinions/rules. These are things that I really have thought through and totally make sense for me. Then reality hits against them and it makes me exhausted.   Example: I think I should not do schoolwork in the weekend,  I already work 5 days a week on school, they already take a lot of time from my life and every week I am exhausted. I need time to relax and do what I want to do. I actually think school and work should not be the center of our lives, instead just a means to an end: getting money to be able to do the things you love. 5 days taken from your week is already a lot.   However, then I come in a situation where I have no other choice and this devastates me. I get really upset and then I go do it, because there is no other choice. Then I go do the work, but afterwards I still feel bad: saturday morning is over and I didn't do what I wanted to do.   Then I do a fun activity, but I'm still like: my morning is still stolen, I have to get more free time to compensate, because we only have one life. The result is that I deprive myself of sleep to compensate.   I then have lower energy, instead of gaining energy so that I can start the week again smoothly.   Principles like that are just so strict to me and I get a mental meltdown if I I can't follow them.  I cannot be like a river, going with flow of the situation and still be okay with that. It is so ingrained in me, if I try to change I get upset too.  Same with, for example, family: I believe in a fast and furious kind of family. You care about people not because of blood/surname, but because you really have history with them, a real connection. Then my mom gets upset if I don't want to visit aunts, uncles and nephew's. To her it's normal to care for people only because of blood/surname.  I care about my parents, brother and friends because of the real connection.   Because of that, I have to vist them. I have come to terms with it by saying I don't do it for myself, but for her. However, it still is a drag because I'm basically going to family gatherings  and have to act. They be like ""I hoped to see you again, it has been a long time"" and then I have to lie against that.  I also have more of these thoroughly thought through things that others just don't see the same way. To me it seems they are not really thinking or that they refuse to accept that someone feels/thinks differently about things than most people do.   It always has been depressing and exhausting me even since I was a kid. There is not much I can do about it. I am powerless.  I wish I had a device that would regulate happiness, so that whenever I am doing something conflicting with these principles/opinions/rules, it would give me happy feelings instead."
joost666,7,"Every week deadlines to programming asignments, I sometimes have to even do schoolwork in the weekend because there is not enough time in the week and there is also a major presentation deadline after a vacation.   Also, with theory subjects, students are procrastinating because of the high workload. They say: ""I will catch up on the theory in the vacation"" . They seem to think that it's completely normal to let them steal even more time of your life. Vacation should be free. (Btw, we need to apply the theory in our software project, so they can't be procrastinating, but they still do.)   Wtf. It is like school doesn't care about our wellbeing at all. Some students are also behind on the programming asignments and are really struggling.   It already is unfair: 5 days school vs 2 days freedom, but they make it even more unfair."

foooood4thought,13,"It occurred to me, that autistic people are actually largely locked out of the job market, due to our inability to drive.  We like restrictive, repetitive activities. Thankfully there are still many of these ""dumb"" jobs. Robots haven't taken over yet.  Great. So wow, look at that truck driver shortage in the UK and Europe. And that's easy. Just become a truck driver. And oh, no, we can't do that, because we can't drive.  Or even, let's do a simple job like delivering the post each day, and ah ,can't drive.  Or ah, let's set up an ice cream truck and just run our own business selling ice cream, and, ah, no. Can't drive.  Or let's even just be a simple security guard where we guard some building or something, and ah, job description says we need a driving license.  OK, let's work in a care home for the elderly, and ah, nope. Wants a driving license!  **Does anyone have any tips for psychological tips for driving a car?**  Does it come down to things like, excessive ""checking"" behaviour?  Do we need to simply filter the number of inputs that we are ""checking"" for?  What is going on? Why do we struggle so much with the psychology of driving? And I say, ""psychology"", because I do believe that it's a psychological state of mind that we are in, as to why we can't drive.  I don't think it's a conspiracy, like, they should make the roads wider, or the driving test easier. There is some psychological state of mind with autism, where we can't drive."

foooood4thought,13,"Have you ever noticed, that lower-functioning autistics, will do ""duplicating"" behaviour?  I have a younger brother, who is lower-functioning autistic, and will literally copy what I do. Very little copying even, like, if I am staying up late, he stays up late. If I am not watching the TV, he will get up and stop watching it.  But the DSM basically seems to believe now, that lower and higher-functioning autism are much the same ""autism"". They have rolled both into a diagnosis of ""ASD"", and ditched the ""Asperger's"" diagnosis.  Therefore, if lower-functioning autistics have this desire to copy things all the time, then so do we.  So, what does it mean, to copy something? And copy what, exactly? And how long does it take us to copy something, so we can move on?  For example, I used to write a lot of diaries, and I still do. I would write these big lengthy diaries of my thoughts. This is helpful for ADHD because we have a poor working memory, and thus, the solution is to externalise things.  But writing diaries can also be described as simple ""copying"" behaviour.  So, we are ""copying"" our internal thoughts onto paper, as best we can.   I would strongly recommend writing such a diary, at least when first working out your strategy or routine for the day, or for life, because we are clumsy when put on the spot.  But the point is this. What about all these other times, where we get upset about a particular thing, and then we want on and on about it? It's tempting to think, we are upset about a particular thing in general, and maybe we are.  But have you considered, that when we are upset about something, our brain really just wants to make a copy of it?  By that definition, how might a laptop connected to a TV via HDMI cable help with that?  If you have ""screen mirroring"" set up on Windows, and now the laptop screen precisely mirrors the TV screen. Now, you can simply occasionally take a brief glance over to the laptop, and then back to the TV.  Interestingly enough, this also may or may not mimick the side to side eye movement used in EMDR therapy and I'm sure a lot of us have some kind of trauma built up for sure.  The other advantage of plugging a laptop into a TV, is that it keeps the screen at head height. They have shown in ADHD subreddit, that it's useful to have a screen line up with your eyes. This seems to impact your attention span massively, if the screen keeps shifting up and down all the time. It feels so much more peaceful having the TV screen at eye line. Of course, your own body will move around, and head, and own eyes, but you can't help yourself doing that. What you can do, is fixate the TV in the same spot, vertically and horizontally, so it just sits there. That's one less odd thing that is moving around and making you nervous. Remember, we get nervous with all these moving things, like cars, people in a shopping. Autistic people panic when anything is moving around in the room, as if it's a whole new room, every time one thing in the room changes.  Other advantages of plugging the laptop into the TV....  It also means that we are not shuffling the laptop around on our lap. Less adjusting etc.  Also no sensory issues of the heat of the laptop on our lap.  Even the weight of the laptop on our lap, and some people don't like weight.  Even having a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse instead of laptop and it's now lighter to just get up off of the chair when we want. Less chances of breaking the laptop accidentally if we drop it, since we aren't actually holding the laptop.  I think that autistic brain is quite efficient, and hates breaking things, losing money etc. Think about the narcissistic autistics who freak out, even if someone accidentally leaves the light bulb on, as if this is costing electricity etc.  I think that the autistic brain is quite efficient, and realises, why not have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse on our lap, rather than the laptop. Because if we accidentally break it, that's less money lost.  One time, I did accidentally trip over my laptop cable and it smashed on the floor and I had to buy another one, or at least, another hard drive.  Now look at that structure too. All we have on our lap now, is the mouse and keyboard. All the power is now away from us. And the laptop itself is then connected to the wider Internet, which is even bigger and more powerful than the laptop. I.e. visualise a data centre.  Ah. So, look at that highly interesting structure that has now formed.   And sure, I do find it interesting to switch my eyes from the TV to the laptop, as a way of, in mere seconds, mimicking this ""duplicating"", ""copying"" or ""mirroring"" behaviour in autism.  This is efficient, because instead of spending 10 minutes writing out a diary of what I'm thinking, and after enough words, being satisfied that I have sufficiently ""duplicated"" my thoughts.   Instead, I take one nice, simple glance over to the laptop, and by all means, hold your eyes there for a few seconds, make your eyes over to the TV, back, forth, and voila, you just did duplicating behaviour with way less time and effort needed."

foooood4thought,13,"With autism, we have poor working memory. We have poor executive functioning. This is just like ADHD. Many of us also have ADHD.  Autism is a one-way condition. We often talk too long in one direction. This is just like ADHD. Many of us also have ADHD.  Everything with autism, is about doing things, in order to do them.  Autism can be described as a ""trial and error"" condition.  For example, by all means try to narrow things down in your head somewhat, before trying something.  But you have to realise, that there is an ""infinite spam"" to ""checking"" behaviour.  I want you to try each day, to get out of ""checking"" behaviour.  Wherever you can, just do something, rather than overthinking it.  There is something called dopamine. Dopamine rewards you for doing something. But if you prolong doing something, you don't get your dopamine.  The quicker you do something, the more you get dopamine.  Dopamine is very similar to sugar. You eat sugar, you get a high, then you get a low. Then you need more sugar, to keep up the sugar levels.  This is why sugar is so addictive. Because you get a high, then it drops, then you need to up your high again.  Dopamine is actually, amazingly, boosted itself, simply by eating table sugar. Table sugar is a great source of dopamine.  OK, but see, exercising causes dopamine.   Defining a task in your head and then carrying it out causes dopamine.  Your brain is not stupid. You cannot ""fake"" doing a task. Doing a task is something that is fundamentally outgoing and extroverted, and ""connecting"" out into the world.  A task, the definition, must be a task which interacts with the world.   If you take a shower, this is a task inside of your own house, so you could call it ""introverted"". But it's not, because having a shower then makes you smell good in front of others. Thus, it is building towards being more ""extroverted"", because now you won't smell bad around others.  Learning knowledge is ""extroverted"". Whereas, going over old traumas or memories in your behaviour is ""introverted"".  Then, we have the concept of ""forgetting"" things. For example, reading a sentence once, doesn't necessarily mean you remember it. Sometimes you do. Sometimes you don't.  So, for example, instead of keeping a list of which things you have already read, you would just read it over again, and you can tell on the spot, whether you remember it, based on whether you remember it! No need to have a ""bookmark"" of where you ""got up to"". Because you either remember it or you don't!  It is very easy to create fake introverted dopamine. Because, if you were in an abusive situation, then even checking out for a narcissist footsteps, and phew, the coast is clear, except, you didn't do that. The narcissist did that on their own whim. The only thing you can ever do with an abusive person is leave them. Reserve your dopamine and energy for tasks where you are not being held down by others. Being held down in the workplace is different, because at least your abusive boss is paying you a salary.  With autism, we are being confused as to what is a task and what is an introverted repeating ""checking"" behaviour.  But back to the original point, you must do things to do things, because we are awful at thinking things through.   For example, let's say you had 3 tasks today.  1. Go to the dentist 2. Go to the grocery store 3. Post off your letter in the post  OK, and you wake up in the morning. And of course, we have problems with autism and sleep. And we are not quite sharp in the morning. OK, a big protein breakfast and caffeine helps with that.  Anyway, which of these tasks do you do first? And in fact, what if you don't have the 3 tasks written down in a notepad?  So in fact, what you do today, is you do the very first plausible task, that you can think of.  Maybe out of the 3 things above, the only once that you remember is the letter in the post. OK, great, do that.  OK, but if you were to think of the other 3 tasks, then maybe you could do the journey more efficiently and save time...?!  No!! Because you never get things done efficiently the first time!!  The first time you do something with autism, you are always going to screw it up! The best way to not screw it up the 2nd time, is to, as quickly as possible, attempt it the 1st time.  The quicker you do it the first time, the quicker you can improve on it the second time  Sure, if you had remembered the grocery store, then maybe you saved time. Maybe you are on the way to posting the letter, and you remember, oh crap! I forgot the grocery store! OK, but see ,at least you got the letter done!  More crucially, at least you got the dopamine high, of achieving the letter thing!  Did anybody here have parents, who told them, when they attempted to do something, that no!! you are doing it wrong!! do it my way!! watch me doing it!! check me doing it!! ""checking"" behaviour .check ,check, check.  Many of us probably had autistic parents, and thus, they got us into this checking behaviour of them, because they were so erratic and controlling.  Again, this is confusing to us, because the workplace is controlling, autistic, narcissistic. In that sense, we have an advantage in the workplace, if we know these tricks. OK, but in your own life, you have to discover new things, by doing it by ""trial and error"".  So, to summarise.... Just do the first plausible thing that comes to mind.  And by the way.. do it QUICKLY, because if we deliberate on it, then we are going to slow down.  A great example would be taking a cold bath. With autism, you should never take warm baths, unless you have some medical reason for doing so. Autism is a condition like ADHD, that benefits from the equivalent of ""a slap to the face"" or ""a cold of ice cold bucket water"" as the treatment. You should get in the bath as quickly as possible, wash yourself as quickly as possible, and get out.  It's the exact same structure with every single task. You are supposed to do it quickly, rather than moving on.  Imagine perfectionism as a big box. And inside is a smaller inner box.   You need to be inside of this smaller box, rather than the bigger one."
No-Watercress-9116,10,"im not sure if anyone knows what being mature means  is it knowing how to socialize? since the age of 15, i flet like i understand most of the details about relationships and friendship but i don't -and will probably never- really know how to socialize since im an aspie  is it having a lot of knowledge about life? ive doubted the existence of god since i was born and im sure my 50ish year old parents never thought about it. (im not saying you have to be atheist im just critiquing not thinking about it at all)  when i was 15, i developped a way of ""controlling emotions"" like controling anger/sadness when dealing with toxic parents or controllig my anxiety when i act awkwardly in a social event etc.  but is this being mature?  i stopped getting near as sad or angry as before, but i also stopped getting as happy as before. i understand everything more but is it actually better to so?  maybe people who make more ""mistakes"" than me and are discovering things much slower (or never doing so) so maybe i need somehow to rewrite my memory and start again like a kid or maybe i just need to ""mature"" more  i like to think about maturing as the first big change in personalty/way of thinking  im not sure tho if it has anything to do with intelligence or if aspies are mostly smarter than NTs  i know that we aspies usually stop growing around the age of 13 or 14, but my guess is that at 14 we're like 30.  its not like you can't grow after that, but you already ""matured"" so you're not gonna change as much as you did before  or to put it in another way, its like the log graph when x>1  sorry if this is overwhelming and if i made any grammatical mistakes cause im not fluent in english  [https://i.imgur.com/i4G9oh3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/i4G9oh3.jpg)"

joost666,7,"We have to do a lot in duo's and hand things in together. Sometimes you both make the asignment and are allowed to discuss, sometimes you do the whole as a pair.  The first 3 weeks we had programming asignments where you both make them all and then hand in one version of each asignment, either from me or him.  He was only be able to start late in the week. He also works while school, even though school is full time..  So while I have everything done on time, or sometimes the last asignment in the weekend, he starts later, he then struggles and can't make the deadline the next week. So, the hard asignments came from me, whe couldn't cooperate and he then has to explain my part also somtimes. We managed to bluff through it (he is supposed to be finished too} , but it really stresses me out.   Also, the teacher contradicts what is said online. He was dissapointed that we didn't cooperate that much. But online it says: ""you make all asignments by yourself and you CAN discuss"". It doesn't say that you must.   Every project I've ever done have procrastinators or people who find it too hard and can't finish and then give up. I have to pass though, so I end up carrying others always.  I know that school is hard and the workload is high, but you want yo pass right? So, just get over it.   Now we also have to do pair programming. I hope he wil manage. But that stresses me out too. I am so tired, whishing for some freedom. They recommend to start this week, but he says maybe, because he still has to finish some other asignment.    There are also other students that don't do everything correct, even though the lecture literally say how things should be done. We are supposed to make use cases and define requirements first, but a teammate has already made architecture.   Why are students like this? Why can't they do exactly what they are supposed to do? They think their own way is better or something.    My mental health is not well at the moment. I whish everything just went smooth, risk free. Everybody listens to what is said, plans things out correctly, we finish on time and then weekend without having to do school work."
joost666,7,"I like online classes. No commute time, no busy classroom, I can copy a screenshot of the powerpoint and put notes below it (I'ts how I take notes), not much human interaction and waking up later. I also have more spare time due to the less commute time.   Some classes are also videos that I can pause, which is nice. I then can take notes and then continue.   Some classes currently are physical unfortunately. I hope it will be a long time before they all are physical again."
joost666,7,"How to deal with this? I miss so much stuff because my brain can't learn things from the environment automatically.  It seems like their brain just absorbs things while I have to focus on a specific thing to really learn it.  I also don't watch the news because of this. I won't remember it anyway.   If you would put me in a restaurant position, without telling me any details, I would be lost. There is too much unclear. I first want to know the details, before applying them.  So, I would constantly be angry with people. ""why didn't you tell met that first"" would go through my head. I don't understand: why not bring out a manuel with exact steps to follow? Then nothing can go wrong ever.   But no, you are expected to pick up things.  I will work as software engineer after graduation and also in obligatory internships and it will be the same principle in a new job."
foooood4thought,13,"The problem with autism, is that we are taking our own thoughts literally.  What is the problem with taking your own thoughts literally?  Someone could simply put something in front of your face, and now you would start thinking about it, talking about it, analysing it in deeper and deeper levels, simply because they put it in front of your face.  And if someone puts it there, can you stop them? Should you punch them? Rip it up? Kill them? Of course not.  So, what can you do? You can mentally swipe this thing to the side, like an app on a phone, swipe it away.  And why can't you do this? Because them putting it there, has triggered an emotional reaction, and emotion hijacks your logic. And, because you need executive functioning to do things like, mentally ignore things and move them out of your mental field of view.  I was able to do this mental manipulation in my head more, when I took an ADHD stimulant. There are actually some countries that will even prescribe ADHD stimulants, even just for autism. Some scientists even looked at the brain and couldn't see any difference between ADHD and autism. These conditions are very similar. They both involved impaired short-term memory, unstable emotions.  Scientists discovered a few years ago, that ""emotion"" and ""logic"" are attached in the brain, and that one offsets the other. You cannot be logical and emotional at the same time. You can be emotional followed by logical, in short bursts each. Obviously there is a ""transition phase"" from ""emotional"" to ""logical"", but you want to keep this transition as short as possible.  OK. One thing in autism, is ""duplicating behaviours"".   If you see very low functioning autism, the kids are literally copying you.  Those of us with high-functioning autism, we are also seeking duplication, just in a more advanced way.  So, when that stupid bully puts the thing in front of your face, you should attempt to find a duplicate of that thing, but somewhere else in the room.  Let's say someone was waving some elephant toy in front of your face to piss you off. Now look around the room to find another elephant. If not, look at least for something grey. Create some kind of other duplicate, to get you out of being ""stuck in a room with you, an elephant, and nothing else"". This claustrophobic type feeling that your walls are caving in.   When something is frustrating you, quickly think of or physically find a duplicate.  Anything to take your mind off of it."

PotentialAgile951,4,I know I'm trying to get a GED hopefully I can do it. The teachers at the high school never thought me anything.  I'm 18 know but I was in special education and I just graduated even though it was a wast of time. You see a certificate of completion is a way of saying thanks for trying but you did not win. Type thing. And I was wondering if anyone else got there GED yeah I know the certification thing is pretty pethatic. So please don't judge me for it.
PotentialAgile951,4,I've only had this happen me once. But I am quite anti social so I don't really talk to anyone if I don't have to. But I could even talk when she was flirting with me.

joost666,7,"My identification card expired, so I have to renew it. However, I'm really busy with school. So, I procrastinate this task. Same with for example going to the dentist, buying presents for a birthday, sinterklaas (kind of dutch santa klaus), barber and other things.   The problem is: it will/might get in the way of the time we have for school (we are really busy) . So, I need to wait a long time until I know for sure that it won't cause problems. I might procrastinate way too long.   I wish I could first finish my degree and then deal with these kind of things, or that school scheduled time for this. On weekends a lot of companies like dentist, barber, and the law hall (don't know what to call it in english) are closed, so it has to be done in weekdays unfortunately.  I won't push school work to weekends. Weekends are supposed to be free time. I don't get much free time anyways, so I have to take what I can get.

PotentialAgile951,4,This is assuming that there would be an afterlife.
joost666,7,Does anybody else just not want to sleep and end up staying up late? I want to have fun and escape. I want to do something I want to do instead of doing what school/life wants. I just want to be free and never have to do any work again.   The problem is that I have to get up early in the moring.
PotentialAgile951,4,A certificate of completion is kind of like saying hey thanks for participating but you didn't win. It makes me feel terrible and like a failure when I think about it. I was in special education that's. Why Im trying to get my GED know so I feel like I accomplished something.
PotentialAgile951,4,I just graduated thank God but when I did go I was in special education. Now I I'm trying to get a GED. Straight out the gate. But I was bullied for being in sped Wich I might add was not very long ago.

joost666,7,"In my software engineering major we have to make  use case diagrams, architecture diagrams and so on for a project.   However, the idea just puts me off, it's a lot of work to put all down. How to be perfectly fine with such big things to do?  I think in general getting used to new things that are  a lot of work is hard being an Aspie. I have this ""I don't want to do all this work, let me remain comfortable"" feeling. The bigness of what I have to do just loads all into my brain.  If I had all the time in the world and no structured school schedule with deadlines, I could gradually learn and get used to anything I want. Unfortunately that isn't the case."

AspiringBiotech,6,"Today I went to grab a cup from Starbucks to get some water because a Team Lead told me I could do that, especially when we’re busy. This young girl who works there said that I should just ask someone instead when there are a lot of people behind the counter and to wash my hands before grabbing a cup when I go behind the counter. Although she’s right about washing my hands probably, I’ve never had anyone else tell me to do so at the Starbucks’s sink and never seen anyone else do it, and I’ve been working here at Target for 2 years. So it came off as pretentious to me. I got furious, in fact. I just said, “ok”, though. Why do things like this bug me so much? Maybe because I don’t like change? Or maybe I just don’t like being told what to do unless it’s by someone who is in charge?"

foooood4thought,13,"The reason you cannot get a job, is because you have a basic misunderstanding of what a job is.  You believe, that a job is more like, build up all the bricks in a house, and be a builder, and keep building the building higher and higher, or even build and own more houses for yourself.  In reality, there are countries like China, that can put up an entire apartment building block, in like 3 days. There are 3D printers that could even print houses in the future.  In reality, these are the jobs involving a house:  The local government creates regulations for the house, e.g. building quality, safety inspections, noise when building it, size limits, fire safety features, and more  The police disallow you to go around knocking down other people's houses, to make a bigger one all for yourself. Or, they stop you stealing other people's houses. Or to stop you getting into domestic abuse in the house and come in to protect you in domestic abuse.  The fire department is on alert if the house burns down, to help you  A gardener could have a job to mow the lawn, cut the hedges  An environmental regulation agency could create laws to prevent you burning unlimited barbecues, bonfires in the back garden, to stop pollution into the environment  A maid could be paid to clean the house, clean the floors, toilets, change the beds, wash them  A care home worker could be brought into the house to take care of the elderly in old age  People have to get into government, even if not to create new laws, but just to maintain sensible existing laws involving housing, building regulations, environmental, maids, gardeners, policing etc  A dog walker could have a job to walk the dog, train the dog, etc.  A plumber could have a job to maintain the plumbing. You could have a job to watch over your plumber, to make sure he is not deliberately ruining your pipes for ""planned obsolescence"" so they keep ""accidentally"" breaking, and you have to keep paying him to fix them  A roofer is going to fix your roof when it leaks. You are going to watch over the roofer to make sure he is not ripping you off  Maybe someone creates a reviews website, like Trustpilot, to ensure that these various construction, plumbing, electrician, handyman type companies are reputable and not ripping you off  Spy agencies have a job to plant a camera or microphone in your house to make sure you are not planning terrorism inside of your house, or molesting children, or whatever dodgy things you could do ""behind closed doors"".  Safety agencies have a job, to make sure that things like, carpets, cookers, ovens etc, are regulated to safety standards, to stop things like, lead paint in the walls, lead in the water pipes, which have been theorised to have contributed to this epidemic of ADHD, and some of these chemicals likely involved in autism too.  And it goes on and on.  Notice something here? All of these jobs in these houses are mostly ""watching jobs"". They are ""maintenance jobs"".  On Wikipedia, it shows the autistic boy stacking up tins cans higher and higher. And what happens when you accumulate all the world's tin cans, and build them to the highest height they will go? Then, what? You can't build them higher, so you must knock them down? Or now you've build them as high as you possibly can, so nothing left to do, so time to commit suicide? See how the autistic logic makes no sense here.  It's not about ""building the house"", but rather, ""maintaining the house"". Your entire job is like being a ""cleaner"".  In fact, every job in the economy can be described as like being a ""cleaner"".  How about the social aspects of any job?  I remember working my first job, and thinking, this is a chatty social club for girls. Study show people do at most 3 hours of productive work in an 8 hour shift at the office. So then, what is the purpose of ""social""? OK, because people can come in and ruin social.   Every system in the world can be flipped and inversed into destruction. That is what the ""psychopathy"" condition is about. Thus, what is the purpose of socialising? Why bother with ""eye contact""? Why bother with even barely noticing that other humans are in the room? Because these humans can manipulate you, manipulate the job, take over it all, ruin it all. So, you are putting up the barriers, putting up the scaffolding, in any given social situation, to prevent bad people getting in. This is why you have to play the social game. So, the social game itself, is a large part of any given job. Keeping bad people out of the job can ensure that the company succeeds. Narcissists can ruin an entire company very easily, as can bad management, and these bad managers are often narcissists.  So do you see here, how everything is more about ""maintaining things the way they are"", rather than, ""building and building"", or ""overthrowing the system, knocking it down, and building it back up again"".  Once you see jobs as a ""cleaning"" or ""maintaining"" job, then it makes a lot more sense."
PotentialAgile951,4,My experience was terrible middle school I was bullied relentless lee. High school every one treated me like a reatard. I was in special education they never thought me anything.

PotentialAgile951,4,I was bullied in elementary school and I cried when Guys pick on me. But sometimes I could hold it in. But Evey time the girls Start making fun of me there was no holding it in. Maybe it's because I'm a guy not sure is that normal are is that just me. It might just be because they were attractive if that even make since. First crush made me cry till my eyes were starting hurting. She was mean because I told her I like her and I have a speech impairment that I absolutely hate myself for.

poke000,29,"I (M30) am happy, healthy, and stable at this point in my life. Like really stable, by any standard.  But looking back at all the challenges I've had to overcome, I don't know how I did. I am privileged enough to live in America and was able to go to college. So that helped. But I was also relatively poor, and did not have a happy childhood. I have ASD, OCD, ADD, and formerly had substance addictions.  By the time I was an adult, I was a mess because I hadn't received the help, the coaching, the therapy I needed in order to function. After living a miserable life for several years, I decided I was going to fix (or learn how to manage) every single issue. One by one. All on my own. No help from family or friends. Actually, I never really had any friends or anyone to turn to for support.  It took a lot of hard work and focus. I wrote down my goals and tracked them every day. I tightly budgeted my time (and money) in order to dedicate my life to undoing all the issues from childhood-- trading in all my fun bad habits for the beneficial ones that nobody wants to do.  The more I think about it, the more I think I have no right to be where I am now. Because there is nothing special about me. There is no quality I have that others don't. I'm not particularly intelligent, and I don't think I'm that mentally strong either. Nor any particular skills or talents to speak of. How was I a success story while others in my circumstances end up homeless or six feet under?"

The comma indicates a pause.)  “This must be done in order to prevent…”  Suggestion: “more concise language would be clearer for your reader” (Basically, the program thinks I should go with simply “must be done to”, which sounds quite unrefined to me)"

joost666,7,"I have a deadline for big long programming asignments every week and you have to hand in asignments in pairs. You have to make all asignments yourself, but you are allowed to talk to your partner.   Every week you hand in all asignments which can be a combination of both works and you have to explain code. The problem is: the asignments are too big. I can manage by forcing myself, but  my partner can't. So I get stressed out because we have to hand the asignments in but he doesn't deliver on time. If I only hand in my work and the teacher will ask him to explain, we are screwed.. Or maybe he is, I don't know.   At the same time we have to do a big project for a real client and we have to learn theory about software engineering and we also have to do research.  Our weeks are hell. How can I enjoy learning things if it has to be like this? I would learn better and also more longterm if the workload wasn't like that. At least the deadlines every week could go away.  I could give up my weekend, but that would probably make things worse because I would be upset of not having relax time.

SpektrumKid,2,"Has anyone else with Aspergers and ADHD dealt with eye floaters? Apparently it's been significantly distracting me, because now I was on eye drops, and it was like my vision was upgraded from VHS to 8K. I can not even overstate the difference. It feels like my brain killed a task that had taken up to 90% of available processor cycles up until yesterday.   I honestly have no idea how I've been able to live with it for so long, without realizing how much it's been bothering me. I think maybe it's possible that it's ableism from articles written about it, or maybe that articles about eye floaters are only written from the perspective of neurotypical people (who are much better at seeing past details, and just looking at the big picture).  Now I have to be a big boy and have eye surgery (where they clean and replace all the transparent fluid in the eye). I'm not sure I can handle that kind of thing mentally, but on the other hand, it feels disingenuous to myself not to do it, since I know what an incredible strain it's been on my brain until now.  At least for now I have the eye drops to relieve my sensory overload level.   Can anyone relate to this? I feel like I had an epiphany. My brain is a visual analyzing super computer, that for the past 4-5 years have been preoccupied with analyzing the debris inside the 'snow globe' that is my aging eye ball.  Wouldn't it just make sense to pay for the upgrade (despite the potential risk with eye surgery?)"
joost666,7,"There are now pronouns like they/them for example, or not calling someone who looks like a boy as he, and this is accepted by a lot of people.  However, what about the aspie minority? When will come the time that you can say that you have asperger's and they treat you accordingly: not giving vague instructions, not giving too much work, not socializing with you, and so on.  I'd be okay wearing a shirt that says I have asperger's. Then they know, because the disorder is invisible.   Why don't we grow so into the public, like the lgbt?

AspiringBiotech,6,"- I’ve spoken to several people who have studied computer science/electronic engineering…and asked them to explain to me how computers translate binary code into electrical signals…I’ll hear very basic descriptions of AND, OR, XOR, NOR gates, etc but if I go any further than that (if I ask them how full adders or digital clocks work, for example) I hear crickets.  - I myself study Biotechnology. When asked about certain biochemical processes involved in Cell Biology, I draw a blank. I know which enzymes are involved in catalysing which proteins in a specific kinase cascade. I don’t often know the full mechanism of action, or understand much more than the bare rudiments of the Chemistry behind what’s going on. The same appears to apply to most of my classmates, as far as I can tell. I haven’t performed a Math problem in over three years now and would fail an Algebra test.  - I’ve known dozens of History students who know absolutely nothing of History.  Now, I realize people forget a lot of what they’ve learned in school. And that memorization is less important to people today because people can look up whatever they need to look up online. But shouldn’t we be sharper, as a nation? Shouldn’t we be using more of our brainpower? Shouldn’t we be using what we’ve learned on a daily basis, reviewing what we’ve learned in the past and building upon it? Do most of us simply feel too demoralized and dejected to be passionate about our studies due to the current state of academia in the United States? Are we just too busy with other things? Too exhausted? Are American schools to blame for distracting people with busy work, encouraging cramming for tests, having extremely low standards, etc? Are we to blame for being social media/video game/TV addicts?"
PotentialAgile951,4,When I was in school I was in special education was not very smart it turns out. And I always got pity but im not going to lie to you. I took advantage of it sometime. When I should have. I school they would pity me the teacher's always gave me special treatment. And I use to like to think I was manipulate them and I wanted the pity. But I was losing to myself to make myself feel better. And help my self esteem I was not actually smart enough to manipulate them. So I convinced myself I was. Because I was insecure and if you said anything to me I would start bawling my eyes out. But I liked to think this because I felt really bad about myself. And whated to feel smart sure I could manipulate them so I didn't get in trouble but that what's the extent of it. Nothing else because I felt they did see me like the other students they know I would never become anything. And I hated them for It so I thought that gave me the right to manipulate them. Dose that make me a bad person are what. Please don't say anything to cruel.

I honestly think that maybe I've never fully understood the concept, as it seems to fall under the 'reputation' umbrella, which also seems foreign to me.  I know what a role model is, which I can define as 'someone that can serve as a moral compass, or artistic inspiration, or aspiration of what you want to become'....  but I don't know if that includes 'respect'?   What are your takes on the word 'respect' and what it means? I guess I think of every person I meet as a clean slate of someone I know absolutely nothing about.... I don't know if I could ever know enough about a person to form an opinion on whether I respect them.  ""I respect you from the data available to me about you""  :)"
foooood4thought,13,"When you write an essay in Microsoft Word, and maybe every time there is a typo, and you correct it, but then, this interrupts your workflow and maybe you forgot what you were going to write?  Instead, you should just write what you are going to write in one direction, and then go back and correct the typos later.  Notice how you are splitting up the tasks into mono tasks here. One thing at a time. Finish one thing. Then go back and finish one other thing. Overlapping these tasks is like ADHD type distraction. This post I am writing may be beneficial to people on the ADHD subreddit.  Or for example, naming files. What will you name your Word document?  OK, but how many Word documents will you write in the history of your life? Does it really matter what you name it? Just highlight the first 5 words in the document and use that as the title. If you make a typo maybe even  in the file name don't even bother correcting it.  Ultimately if you wanted to find the file again, you could go through the entire hard drive and open each file until you find it etc.  An obsessive desire to tabulate things properly. Just write it anywhere. I find that writings things in my own words helps better than figuring out how to format it into a table.  It's like we got into this habit while at school, of writing something to ""academic"" standards, and it's just a mentality that barely works in the real world and is annoying pedantic academic nonsense. Just write it how you want.   For example, if you can correct something as you are writing it, then surely when you re-read it in the future, your brain can also make the same correction. Thus, you can correct it even, ""mentally"" and ""in your head"" and ""in your imagination"", rather than having type out the correction as you are going along, or frankly, don't even bother going back through it and ever correcting it, unless you have to hand it in as an essay. But even then, I wonder if universities should just allow people to hand in work with poorly written handwriting, or even in ADHD, to allow students to just draw pictures of things in their essay. After all, drawing pictures doesn't  make you dumb maybe you just have an ""audiovisual brain"".  Just try to think about, how much energy and stress in your life, has gone into writing things in the right ""format"", when you damn well what you are trying to say, and society is like caving itself in with this pedantic correcting of everything to some ""precise"" standard.  Of course, any structure where you are doing it to a standard, then gives the creator of the standard, all this power over you.  A simple example is the entire business model of tech companies, locking you into their proprietary formats etc. I tried using Apple MacBook and it was like hell on earth, making you format everything in Apple's way. And then in some future update, Apple will change the way that you format it, and now they are wasting more of your time when you are just trying to use the damn thing and be productive  Ultimately it may be a long shot to convince society to get out of this mentality, and this may just be why so many of us are unemployed, underemployed, or start our own business so we don't have to communicate in these stupid standards and formats that do nothing other than slow us down and give other people power over us"

PotentialAgile951,4,One has seen me cry because I was crying at my high school and the teachers whent and got her I felt really embarrassed for crying in front of her because she is my younger sister I mean I was really crying like a baby  she asked me why of course I lied to her but wondering if anyone one else whould feel the same as me embarrassed that my sister seen me crying not that she would make fun of me are anything but I still have my pride as a man
New_Shoe9530,39,"These exist because when writing them or expressing themselves in words, one would enter the situation of ""the letter of the law against the spirit of the law""   And this because neurotypicals understand this at an instinctive level, and follow these rules at a subconscious level in most cases, putting them in writing in most cases (NTs), would be an unnecessary and even dangerous complication, due to to what would be a situation in which it would be almost impossible to realize what is evident, it would be a case of ""analyzing the obvious"", which will make problems worse and allow people to self-justify in most cases   Or at least this is what I arrived at and what my father confirmed to me"

PotentialAgile951,4,I was bullied in elementary school I never told my teachers they caught me crying and I just told Them it didn't matter while pouring my eyes out the asked once are  two times then give up but my class was small like twenty kids every one of them were bullying me even the one I had a crush on I whould always cry when she said something to me more than the other Gus's because I like her are something don't know for sure just a guess

PotentialAgile951,4,I'm autistic never been on a date I'm not sure a girl whould ever accept me so I was wondering if anyone could give me any tips I know there probably not much hope for me I get to nervous then I can't talk it's like it is just not meant to be I'm 18 never been on a date never kissed anyone never even held hands with someone is there any hope for me at all I feel I whould be to nervous to make the first move and I'm a boy so I'm supposed to make the first move there was one girl that show interest in high school but she even told me she likes me and I was to nervous to speak like the one  time I need to speak and I can't so that didn't work out like I wanted It may have been my only chance how do I date
PotentialAgile951,4,I know that sounds bad but I am embarrassed to tell someone this not that I have friends so not like I have any one two tell anyway but I was always bullied in elementary school and it made me feel really ashamed of myself and what I was because it seems like everyone hated me so I learned not so say anything a all better to have no friends rather than people that are going to make fun of you all the time
PotentialAgile951,4,I was diagnosed with autism as a kid and probably not Asperger's at the time but I was wondering what the difference is so I know which I am.
joost666,7,"How to not get tired when you have to do a full time internship/ work fulltime on school?   How to deal with a ridiculous workload like expecting me to do 3 really dificult programming asignments a week and the deadline the next week, while also having a project for a real person?   How to not get frustrated by not having much free time? And when I have free time, I'm too tired to play a game for example... I can do that in the weekend but not often after a school day.   I'm also really afraid of communication and have to do two more obligatory internships. I have a mental blockade because of not knowing how the other will react.   After I graduate, I will work part-time to enjoy my life more, but now I need to get through 1,5 more years of hard work in college for a bachelor's degree."

AspiringBiotech,6,"You know what I’m talking about. You give them an inch (“oh, let me help you with that!”) and they try to take a mile (“hey, come here…I need you to ___ and ____….oh, and even though you’ve been here for several years and I’ve been here for two weeks, you need to start doing your job this new way”). I’m trying to be polite. Don’t push me."
AspiringBiotech,6,"I know few people wish to discuss Cell Biology, History, etc, at work. So I tend to not even think much about my favorite subjects there. It only ever seems to bore and or annoy coworkers. I allow my mind to go blank and just make small talk and jokes. Yet I often feel that, because of this, I’m harming my ability to converse with fellow nerds and allowing my mental capabilities to deteriorate. My thoughts are scattered and I have trouble remembering certain facts/putting things together to form a big picture.   I also cringe at myself for withholding facts I know are true to avoid political conflict. I sometimes probably give the impression that I agree with people regarding their horrid political stances because I get nervous and laugh or try to pretend what they said wasn’t a big deal. This makes me feel very uncomfortable and guilty. But I used to get into heated arguments as a young adult, and I now avoid them like the plague.  A friend at work the other day acted completely shocked when I told him I studied Biology (at the graduate level, nonetheless). He said, “are you, like, really smart?” I tried to explain that I’m “smart” in some ways but below average in others. I’m better at expressing myself through writing than via speaking, for example. No. I don’t consider myself highly intelligent. I used to be well-read, nearly fluent in German (which is good for an American who has never left the country), and an excellent note-taker, however."
Competitive_Bid7071,16,To be honest I felt a bit overwhelmed by my experience there as they really didn’t seem to teach me what they promised they would. Along with the fact that they seemed less focused on the higher functioning kids and more on the lower functioning ones. It kinda annoyed me a bit but my mom told me it should be different next week.
joost666,7,"When I try to or have to learn something new, I always am afraid that it won't be useful.  We are now learning research  in software engineering mayor because school wants us to do that in the internships. However, I don't think my job after school will involve that. Every college just has this at the final years in my country, even if the job does not involve that.   It was the same with a lot of high school subjects. I know that you will get some out of it, after talking to someone here: a better developed brain, even if you don't remember most of the stuff.  However, I still am so afraid that there were some useless lessons that didn't contribute to my brains development and my knowledge and I will get some of useless lessons in the future. I already had some lessons that stated the obvious or things that I already knew or deductions that I could easily make myself.   The reason that I'm afraid is that we only have one life and I should be doing what I like and useful things to be able to live. All the other things is time I lose and won't ever get back. I'm highly anxious of losing time of my life.  I am not in control of curriculums unfortunately, so I can't do anything about it. I can't ask ""hey, I already know this, can I skip this subject?"". I also can't say ""this is obvious, let's skip this"". I also can't say ""this won't benefit me, let's skip it"". I'm totally powerless and it often eats me up. Then I have to face that when it's eating me up, I'm also wasting time of my life."
SpektrumKid,2,"I really never lived my life as myself, and now I'm half way through. It feels unfair, but at the same time I'm glad I actually get the chance to live my life as myself.

foooood4thought,13,"Has anybody tried brain stimulation? Such as, rTMS, ECT etc? I know that some depressed people use this, but I'm always interested in whether the results are different with autism + depression."
joost666,7,"I always studied too hard to pass a class/asignment on the first try. (You have 2 chanches). This is because doing and learning for the resit will mess with the next semester, other subjects in the current semester or steal away time of a vacation. (They already steal enough time)   Because of that anxiety, I want to finish everything directly, as soon as possible , instead of allowing myself to gradually working on it. My mind keeps obssessing with a subject to finish it as soon as possible. If I try to put an assignment on hold, my mind is like: I could do a bit more on it and really finish it today, then I can relax again. I often feel really anxious and can even burnout sometimes because of this.   Also, just before a test I keep repeating the stuff over and over again. Ideally, I wouldn't have to, but I am just too afraid to fail the test the first chance en have these consequences.   NT's seem just be able to sit back and accept if they don't get it the first chance. They also can learn things gradually without getting anxiety.    I wish studying wasn't like this. If they didn't give grades and you couldn't pass or fail, I would just be able to study relaxed without consequences, which is the best for learning for me. If you then don't understand a subject well enough, it isn't a problem. Most of the time you will forget a lot of it afterwards anyway and you have to relearn it on the job or just on your own at home."
New_Shoe9530,39,"To be honest, my greatest wish is to reach the level of a capybara.  Some way specific to us, and yes, I know, most of us are 1000% or 0%, but we can try to make this work?"

foooood4thought,13,"How many of you had clumsy accidents below the age of 5? Apparently this is the real reason Aspergers average life expectancy is lower.

foooood4thought,13,"Does anyone have any meaningful examples, in their own lives, of successful autism workplace accommodations? Or is this just the government pretending to help?  My view is that outside of maybe allowing ear muffs, that we are failing in the workplace just because most jobs are not suited for us, and then tech, engineering jobs are too difficult for most of us? This leaves us with basically low wage jobs and maybe some quirky side business ideas or stock trading or something to supplement the income."
Nicenastybuttercup,19,"I have 4 separate mental illnesses so I didn’t  really know what to attribute this feeling to, but I think its spectrum related where I’ll have specific, visceral feelings that literally no one else can relate to so they think I’m lying and invalidate what I’m feeling."
joost666,7,"If I say that I don't want to go to school fulltime because I don't have the energy and it is unfair to get only 2 days freedom for 5 days school, some people would get upset and say: others would be happy to be able to study. (Same with work after that ofcourse.)   It's like some other people suffering more than me makes my struggles less valid.   If we have only one life I should care about what I want in life. Life is way too short to look at every single human being.  Seeing things relative also doesn't make the situation better.  If some 10 year old works in a factory for 20 hours a week, should he be like: ""It's not that bad, the other kid works 40 hours?"", It still is  bad."
foooood4thought,13,"The world will never have an autistic nation state.  Why?  Autism can be easily faked. You will get spies as infiltrators.  Autism diagnosis is easily researched in the DSM and online.  In the future, perhaps there is a brain scan that can scientifically prove autism.  OK, and then spies will hack into the brain scanning machine and produce a fake ""proof"" of autism.  And how about Elon Musk's Neuralink? Musk claims he will ""cure"" autism, by altering the brain. But surely, Neuralink can also ""cause"" autism too. So, spies can use Neuralink to deliberately cause autism and once again, infiltrate.  Everything in this world can be duplicated and faked. I sometimes think that the entire condition of autism is a ""disorder of duplicates"", where we don't realise how easily we can fake things."
Saiyanobe_23,27,I am 19M and I learned to accept the fact that I will never have true friends or a girlfriend in my life even if I go to college none of that is gonna happen. Why because in college every one is extremely mature and set to focus on themselves and most people in college don’t even have friends or are in relationships. Tbh in my opinion I think relationships are overrated the only relationships I have are my family even tho they’re complicated. I just think sex and romantic relationships with other people who aren’t related to you is very pointless and stupid in life and I feel like deep down people should only focus on their families that support them and themselves strictly only themselves in life and that’s exactly what I’m gonna do.

Nicenastybuttercup,19,"I was like, omg a picnic table that never gets used, if that picnic table could think it would wonder why no one likes it and it wouldn’t understand that it’s not its fault.  I was seriously on one as a kid 😂"
foooood4thought,13,"To tell, or not to tell. That is the question.  I feel like, if you tell people, you might stand out, and society is all about blending in. I feel like you are putting yourself in the ""special person"" category. People might also resent you, as if you are somehow asking for special treatment, in a narcissistic sense.  Whereas, if you do tell people, then maybe they can at least understand, why you come across as ""rude"" for not doing the right facial motions. They might interpret your ""flat affect"" as being an insult, if they didn't realise that you had a condition.  The question is also, who do you tell? Perhaps it is appropriate to tell your spouse, before, or after, your first date. But then, what about colleagues, parents, siblings, etc?  Let me ask you all. Who, if anyone, have you told about your autism. What were the reactions, consequences?"
joost666,7,"You are supposed to shake hands, but what if you didn't? Would the outcome of a meeting really be different? You can just say ""hello"" instead.   In the Netherlands we have a way of adressing old people. It is supposed to be respectful. It is a different word for the dutch equivalent of ""you"".  They never explain why this is respectful. If they use it with me when I'm old, I would be like: ""why do you remind me that I'm old? ..."". It is also feels putting old people above yourself. Aren't we supposed to be equal?  We kiss secondary family 3 times on the cheek. But why?  Isn't one kiss enough? Why even kiss, just say goodbye.   You are supposed to let women go first through a door, according to some people. That does not make it seem men and women are equal. It makes it seem women are above men. I propose: if man is closest to the door he opens, otherwise the other way around.   The same with men opening car doors for women. I propose: if driver == man: man opens; Else: woman opens ;  It apparently is polite to say ""can I order"" when calling to order fastfood. But what else are you gonna do if you call a line that is set up for ordering food? It would be better to just start your order immediately after saying hello.   Cashiers are supposed to say hello and it is seen normal if they talk to customers. However, this talking slows the queuespeed down. Why not just go all self scan? Cashiers jobs are actually redundant if you have a good system in place.   You are supposed to hang out with people just because you have the same surname/genes/""blood"".Let me choose who I hang out with! I believe more in a vin diesel ""family"". You don't have to be related to really care about eachother.   The 5 days a week school and work is a weird norm. If I go to school/work 5 days a week, why don't I get 5 days back of freedom? 2 days is not really a fair trade. (I will search for a part-time job after graduation).   9 - 5 is also too much. You have to go home and maybe cook after that. (I will freeze food in the free days when I will live alone, so I don't have to do that)   It is the norm that kids should play/be a kid and not be forced to do things, but I've seen one father who let his kid as a baby listen to music notes and the verbal word for them. The kid devloped perfect pitch. So, although you sacrifice freedom of the kid, shouldn't we take advantage of the high learnability of kids/babies? That way he will be a genius in something when older, because he aquired the power when he had superlearning ability.  There are all sorts of cutlery rules that restaurants apperently follow. Does it really matter? The customer will just put the cutlery how he wants it in mere seconds.   Pizza hawaii is looked dowm upon because you aren't supposed to put pineapple on a pizza. If someone likes it though, what's the problem?   You are supposed to look others in the eye even though you can just communicate with words just fine.   Can you add more things?   If all people just learned to have an open mind to everything, the world would be so much better. But no, there are rules once set and never reconsidered and everyone is expected to follow them.   I will not treat others like that. I will never tell someone to be normal. I will treat others like  unique and independent, apart from the rules of society. If someone likes pizza hawaii, let him eat it. If someone doesn't want to talk to a cashier let him. If a cashier doesn't want to talk, let him too. I wouldn't mind a cashier just pointing at the price and at the bankpassthingy and then I pay and go. (Don't even need to point, because the bankpassthingy has a screen which says you can pay). If someone doesn't want to shake hands or look me in the eyes, it's okay.  I wish we treated every human as an entity with it's own rules and not make up rules together, except for really necessary rules, like: don't steal, don't murder."

New_Shoe9530,39,"Any advice, of any kind"
AutoModerator,26,"**What Is Asperger's Syndrome?**  Asperger's Syndrome (AS), also known as High-Functioning Autism (HFA), is the old name for what is now generally called Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Level 1. It is a neurological disorder characterised by a difficulty with communication, a lack of social awareness, unusual use of vocal and non-vocal language, a greater or lower sensitivity to one or more stimuli, and obsessive patterns of behaviour or activities. People with ASD are often bullied, marginalised, and generally discriminated against for their unusual behaviour by neurotypicals (NT) making it difficult to enter into friendships or relationships, leading to loneliness, depression, and suicide. The cause is currently suspected to be a mixture of genetic and environmental causes, though there's little evidence for any theory. All we know for sure is that ASD is lifelong and uncurbable, though therapy can help. For more information please visit the [FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/wiki/faq).  **Why Get A Diagnosis?**  An official diagnosis can help you understand yourself, your behaviours, and can rule out other conditions that often overlap with ASD but are treated differently. Examples include Depression, Social Anxiety, [Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)](http://hsperson.com/), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Social Communication Disorder (SCD), and a number of other disorders. For many a diagnosis is an answer to a lifelong question of why they felt so different.  It can also get you access to various support programs. In the UK you can receive [Personal Independence Payments](https://www.gov.uk/pip), several employers will guarantee an interview for applicants with disabilities including autism. You can gain special permissions, such as wearing shoes that are normally disallowed in a dress code or exemptions from performing certain types of work. Schools and universities can offer you more time to complete exams or access to tools and mentors to help with your learning.  **Should I Get A Diagnosis?**  Some people don't get a diagnosis for a variety of reasons, preferring instead to refer to themselves as self-diagnosed. Depending on where you live getting a diagnosis can be expensive, overly difficult, a great deal of hassle, or in some instances literally impossible. There are online tests that can indicate how likely you are to be on the spectrum, however they are not a substitute for an official diagnosis  required to get access to the previously mentioned support programs.  * The [Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)](https://psychology-tools.com/autism-spectrum-quotient/). Scores above 32 on this 50-question test indicate a high probability of ASD. * The [Ritvo Autism Aspergers Diagnostic Scale-Revised](http://www.aspietests.org/userdetails.php?target=/raads/questions.php). Scores above 65 on this 80-Question test indicate a high probability of ASD. Much more accurate.  **How Do I Get A Diagnosis?**  A diagnosis will normally consist of several interviews with a professional who will observe your behaviour and ask a series of questions design to reveal your ways of thinking. These questions will be a mix, some about how you would behave in certain theoretical scenarios, other about life events and how you reacted to them. They will also ask about your current abilities and if you've demonstrated any others in the past. As previously stated, getting a diagnosis is often very difficult if not impossible, it depends entirely on where you live. Every option has a very long wait time, usually over a year.  In the UK:  * [The NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/getting-diagnosed/how-to-get-diagnosed/) has a page explaining the process.  In the US:  * [Autism Source](http://www.autismsource.org/) is a search engine for local resources. It provides options for filtering and services can be searched based on location. You will have to pay for most services. * [Autism Society](http://www.autism-society.org/) \- This society has local support groups that meet. Attending allows you to connect with others and discover resources in your area. There is a focus on parents with children but they are adding resources for adults as well. * [California Regional Centres](http://www.dds.ca.gov/RC/RCList.cfm) \- California has services for disabled people available at Regional Centres in the state. Services can include free diagnosis and supports after diagnosis. All ages are included. There can be a long wait time and it may require persistence. Services are not limited to autism.  Elsewhere in the world:  * Check with your national healthcare provider or talk with your doctor, they will normally be able to direct you in the right direction.  * We want to provide as much country specific information as possible, if you can please let us know where people in your country should go for a diagnosis or support.  **I Have a Diagnosis, What Now?**  What you do with your diagnosis is entirely up to you. You can tell your friends and family or keep it to yourself, use it to get government assistance or accommodations made for you at work. A lot of people feel a sense of closure after acquiring theirs, others don't and continue to explore their neurology and mental state.  Be aware that when sharing your diagnosis people may change their attitude towards you, suddenly treating you more like a child or a freak. Others may outright deny that it's correct, declaring that there's nothing wrong with you or that you just want an excuse for being lazy. Family and friends alike distancing themselves after learning of a diagnosis is an unfortunately common horror story, unwilling to be associated with an autistic individual.  **Other Resources**  * [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) \- A central location for groups of all kinds and their meeting schedules. Search for autism in your area for a support group. You can find out a lot of information from other people dealing with autism. You can narrow the search for groups for young adults or teenagers. * [Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN)](http://autisticadvocacy.org/) \- A non-profit group run by autistic people for autistic people. They have chapters in the US and a few overseas. They also have pages on social media where you may be able to find out more information. * Social Media Sites - Search for autism on social media sites you frequent, you may find information about local groups on places like Facebook or Twitter. * [AAASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit](http://autismandhealth.org/) \-  Link for help in going to a health care appointment. * [Musings of an Aspie, Adult Diagnosis](https://musingsofanaspie.com/adult-diagnosis/) \- Series of articles describing the diagnosis for an adult"

Violence, suppressed emotions, shame about sex, conflicts between people of different ideologies.... all seem to have a flair of denial and 'being above the rest of the animals' somehow.   We aren't much different than Dolphins, monkeys or elephants. Even snakes has an instinct for survival everyone who's a human being can recognize just the same.  If we suppress our instincts, and are ashamed to talk about them because we are 'supposed to be more evolved', then we end up with toxin masculinity (desperate people who are clinging on to a fleeting ideal of what a man is 'supposed to be').   Ego trippers who are so obsessed about improving themselves to the extent that it becomes a competition between people to be the best, also in a stride to run from the fact we are just animals and we don't have to actually compete amongst ourselves to prove anything.  What about just striving towards being a decent person, whilst accepting all our flaws, strengths, origins and mixes. We are an amazing species. We just have our head up our butt about where we come from.  Humanity? Get over yourself, and grow up. It's time."
joost666,7,"Before the vacation, I was perfectionist with learning all the knowledge, because I don't know what they want me to know, and never procrastinating. I also took over work in projects from others, because they were procrastinating and if we didn't finish, we would have to do a resit.    I'm studying IT in college currently, but have been burned out by this behaviour.   For every asignment or test we have two chanches and when you don't succeed the first try, you have to resit.    The reason of my behaviour is that having to do a resit and learning has to be done while still having the subjects of the next semester.   If you don't succeed the second try, you have to do it the year after, which is even worse to manage.   I passed everything, but often at a great energy cost. I entered the obligatory internship the same way: let's finish this immediately, let's get this over with so I don't have to redo it. Then, the person I would do the job for and my schools instructions were really vague and I burned out by it. (also had low energy already from the semester before that)   If I could have a more learning only atttitude, it would be better. But the consequenses of not passing something make me too anxious. This hastly passing everything also makes me remember less things, which is not good, because I need to use the information later.   We only have one life and in highschool I learned too much things I will never do anything with again. I don't want to waste anymore of my life again. These system steel time of our lifes. I just want school be over with, have a part-time job and enjoy my life."

joost666,7,"The school system is build around  forrest-first learning: they provide you an hollistic network and let the details come later.  This is because most NT's learn this way. This is stated in a book ""A field guide to earthlings"", by Ian Ford.   As an Aspie however, I learn in a tree-first way. I learn the individual details and then compose a forest.  How do you learn in the forest-first environment, when you have tree-first learning? I feel like at the moment I can manage, but it might take me more energy. I also don't remember the big picture afterwards, because they don't give me enough time to connect all the dots and keep it permanent in memory. One semester is just really short. The things I learnt, I can't instantly use one month after learning them."

joost666,7,"They seem to really want to do big things in work, have some high job position, improve until the highest level, work hard, compete with others, make impact on the world and put in lots of hours. They also talk passionately about their achievements.   The reason that school and work is 5 days a week is also because of this. They seem to all revolve around work. To me they have stolen time of my life with this system, because going to school 5 days a week does not get compensated enough by only two days of weekend. In total the amount of days of vacation also doesn't compensate for this.   I just want to work as less as possible and enjoy my hobby's at most.

foooood4thought,13,"Read through a book, start to finish.  First time. Highlight every time something happened in the year 1939  Start the book all over again.  Second time. Highlight every time Winston Churchill did something  Start the book all over again  Third time. Highlight every time a casualty statistic was reported in World War II  And on, and on, and on, and on.  You can re-read the same book endlessly, noticing something new each time.  You can even overlap multiple highlighting with each other. For example, what things did Winston Churchill say in 1939.  It sounds tedious to do this. But with autism, I’m pretty sure this is the only way to extract useful ideas out of a book.  Has anybody used this technique?"

foooood4thought,13,"What is the ""perfect"" back rest? How comfortable should the back of your chair be? If you keep digging your back into a chair, how long until the chair breaks?  I would recommend, sitting upright, not having a back rest at all.  Then, when your back gets tired, sit down, lie down, etc.  Then, go back to a session of sitting upright again. Maybe 30 mins at a time, maybe more, maybe less.  Some people with autism have POTS, upright high heart rate. Or, they have upright low blood pressure. Forms of orthostatic intolerance. Even then, the answer is to sit upright in sessions, then have periodic breaks, etc."
joost666,7,"I seem to have this blockade in my head when talking to people.   If I need to explain something (for example an Asperger's trait that I have) , ask for something, state an opinion, negotiate, discuss or something else, I can't manage to do it because of the thoughts that they might react in some negative way.    I don't know that they will react negatively, but the fact that they might, terrifies me. I can't read their minds.  Because my Aspie mind is so much different, I also can't predict their reaction based on how I would react. I have done this often before and they didn't react the way I predicted. They reacted way different. They were weirded out, sometimes angry. I'm highly aware that this self-projection doesn't work with me. (Unfortunately, it often goes automatically)   Sometimes I predicted someone would react negatively and procrastinated saying what I wanted to say. When I finally said it, my anxiety was really high, because the thing I said was something I should have said way sooner. In the end, their reaction wasn't bad at all.    An  example is asking for a better explanation of a schoolasignment via mail. They might react badly and say something like: ""It is stated clearly on the paper!"". Then I would meet them at school and they might see me as stupid. But the way they write the assignment can be really vague to me. Maybe to NT's not btw.   According to the book ""how to handle neurotypicals"" self-projection is really a problem with Aspies. There are rules to counter the self-projection in the book:  Rule #1: Remember: you’re fabulously, but undeniably weird. Never assume that another person is ‘basically’ or ‘fundamentally’ the same as you   Rule #2: If it quacks like you and walks like you, it still may be very different from you. Never assume that someone who behaves like you, actually is like you.   Rule #3: Never presume that someone who doesn’t behave like you now, can or wants to learn to behave like you in the future.  However, without the  self-projection I'm truly lost. I have no way to predict how someone might react. I wish I could read their minds.   So in  short, with the self-projection I'm lost, because the difference in our NT and ND minds is too great, so self-projection is inaccurate. But without, I have truly  nothing to determine their behaviour/reaction.  How do you deal with this?"
joost666,7,"There is so much going on in the world. A friend told me about the taliban and the retreat of US soldiers.   I didn't know that, but everyone else seems to constantly keep up with all those things in the world. They also seem to dislike if you don't do that.   However, my brain just isn't built for a constant stream if info like that. I would have to constantly update models in my head. This takes energy and doesn't always go automatically. I don't absorb things like others.   There is also already a lot to focus on in my own life: college, dealing with people, dealing with anxiety.  Also, I have one life and if I'm constantly hearing about bad things, things I don't care about and/or things I can't control, I won't be happy and wasting my time. I should focus learning fun and/or usefull things instead of letting my energy go away.   I choose to not care about anything in the world unless it affects me, like the rules our government gives about covid.   Does anybody else not keep up with the world too?"

Competitive_Bid7071,16,"This is something I’ve felt about for a while but never got the chance to express it, i don’t mind dark humor and other such things but I have a hard time taking lots of modern YouTube Reviewers or commentators seriously because they like to use “edgy” personas in there videos especially when they try to be “objective” in it. Like if your going to be serious and actually make good points why bother being edgy and annoying just for some cheap laughs and to make jokes that aren’t even funny…? It just makes them look like reactionary morons who don’t even take what they’re reviewing or debating seriously and it makes them look extremely, extremely immature and disingenuous when they talk about something.  But that’s not the worse thing these types of “reviewers” or “commentators” sometimes they use this excuse if “playing a character” just to be toxic a**holes and to get away with the most vile and disgusting things I’ve ever seen online such as harassment and doxing of people that criticize there points because there either to narcissistic or toxic to see there faults. Along with spreading racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and other far right and reactionary talking points on there channels to influence there gullible viewers who also form cults of personality around these people.  It’s honestly annoying how these people can get away with this and how lazy content like this is somehow “well liked” by so many people.

Competitive_Bid7071,16,I don’t know why but for a long time I’ve had this issue to where I feel paranoid to look at other people or try not to be around people based on how there dressed. For instance if I see someone wearing a particular set of clothing or jewelry such as a gold chain I feel immediately paranoid to be around them. Part of me thinks it’s because that type of jewelry is based on what stereotypical “gangsters” wear in movies and in other media and I somehow think it’s real. Although it could also be due to factors as to how I was raised. Do you have any advice as to how I can stop these feelings?

foooood4thought,13,"Is it possible, that high levels of autistic homelessness, can be attributed to a desire for fresh air?  If you live in a hotel, you can get professional cleaners, to clean the room once per day. You can either book the hotel on certain days, or even long term. But the assumption with hotels, is that most guests stay for one night, and thus, hotels have a once-a-day cleaning service.  I have autism. I also have anosmia. I have absolutely no sense of smell whatsoever.  I have since learned, that smells can accumulate in the air, in fabrics, from trash cans, from carpets, from clothes, from not having the window open.  There is something called hay fever, or grass, pollen allergy. If you open the window to make the room more fresh, you risk letting pollen into the room, and triggering your hay fever.  I have often had feelings or fears of, what if I am homeless, where would I live, or sometimes even a desire to be homeless, like, wouldn't this be cool? Or, this is a way to save money on rent.  But, what if the real reason for this, is simply due to the room being stuffy?  Autistic people often struggle, to clean their teeth, wash their clothes, shave their beard, have showers. Thus, cleaning a room, changing the bedsheets, vacuuming the floor, taking out the bin liners. This stuff is a much more difficult thing.   People with autism might even get lazy, and masturbate into their boxer shorts, and accumulate long-term smells, and ultimately they just need to throw out the boxer shorts and get new ones.   People with autism often neglect their teeth. I haven't confirmed this yet, but it seems surely very likely, that bad teeth, rotting teeth, would also smell bad.  In any event, homelessness is clearly not entirely caused by a desire for fresh air. Other issues are at  play, such as, unemployment, difficulty in socially interacting. Many autistic people will be too scared to even phone up a landlord, or apply for a job, or even ask their relatives to house them. Autism can go with OCPD, which involves a refusal to delegate tasks to other people. Autistic people may well have been provoked at school, in domestic abuse, and hit somebody back, been jailed, and then struggled to find a job due to a criminal record. Often in society, the person who provokes you, gets away with it, and you get in trouble, if you retaliate. Ultimately, autistic people need to learn, this concept of ""one-to-many"", versus ""many-to-one"", and realise that if somebody wants to kill you, there are infinite ways to do it. If you don't want to get a job because one day you might get fired, well, there is no such thing as a guaranteed job. Only in North Korea. Only in slavery. Autistic people need to realise that certain medications may reduce the desire to be homeless, such as SSRI or stimulants. Some people even said stimulant medication would help people even without ADHD, and just pure autism. There is some evidence that autistic people don't do well on anti-depressants and SSRIs, and what they really need is stimulants. ADHD and autism have a lot in common, and scientists could barely detect any difference in the brain scans of ADHD versus autism.  I wrote about this a few months ago. But I really would pay attention to this concept. Humidity, stuffy room, even airborne allergens, as a sensory issue. Think about the atmosphere in the very room that you are sitting in, and could this be making you depressed?"
joost666,7,"I've come to a point where I've been fed up with the constantly learning. First it was in highschool, one big time period of too much work and not enough energy and now college.   I also don't understand why you can't specialize at that point. I really liked guitar in highschool, but I had to go to school, so how could I master it if I didn't have time/energy. ""You have to really be good to enter music study"". Yeah, but if the system doesn't allow me to put in the hours,  how could I actually become good enough at that time, for the entry level? That's why I couldn't do that. Now I'm pursuing software engineering.   I wish this summer vacation just lasted forever. There was a time that I just was motivated to keep learning, in the first year of college. But now I am like: is this how life is going to continue to be? Endless learning with no end? It's just the same as highschool again. I also have to do 2 obligatory internships after the last school period..  When learning something like piano it's fun and I don't get fed up, because I don't have a time limit for things. I can just learn at my own pace. No schedule that is forced upon you. No deadlines. No consequences for failure. I can just choose freely what I do. With school and work later this isn't the case.   I hope I can find a job after graduation that is just easy, constantly the same, but one I still can do as part-time as possible, so that it still pays well enough to afford something small . I don't want possible failure, I don't want stress. I don't want to learn new things unless I don't have a deadline to learn them.   Maybe when the semester starts, my motivation might go back. Does anybody else have this lack of motivation to go on?"

Or are they typical of each human being?  Edit:Honestly the reason why I can do things even feeling exhausted, is that for a long time I did not know how to distinguish between ""relaxed"" and ""exhausted"" so despite being exhausted I kept doing things since I honestly believed that I was relaxed, since I only knew differentiate it by context.   I only learned the difference a week ago and it is still not very clear   This turned out well until college when I went to study medicine dragging a depression for years without knowing it, so to try to keep up, I ended up studying as if I was working in a Japanese black company where their employees are abused.   It didn't turn out well, let's just say that in ways I still don't understand, I ended up with little blood to my brain and my psychiatric meds weren't working, and if we took the shit out of a horror movie or at least black comedy, it came to my current therapist to tell me. has helped a lot"
joost666,7,"Because I have asperger's syndrome, my way of learning was different. Also, I got overwhelmed, so I couldn't focus and store things in my memory correctly.   If I learn something at home in my own way, I can truly learn things without being held back.   One time with Spanish, I notices that doing excersizes in a workbook to recall words didn't work that well for me. Instead, I opened the textbook and started to just learn the words as a list.   The teacher saw this and started asking: ""why don't you do the assignments"". Me: ""this works better"".  The teacher didn't believe it,  so I said that I would prove it on the test. On the test I scored along with the top, maybe even the highest grade, ai don't remember. After that I kept getting good grades in Spanish.   The teacher never got in my way again. But, the classes didn't really give me any benefit.   The same with some other classes.  Going to classes in school also is waste  of time because of traveling to and from school. When I got home late,  there was also not enough energy to do homework. It would often be better to skip some classes and learn at home. Homework would be no problem and then I could even have done fun things afterwards more often.  But no, classes were obligatory.   I get why classes are obligatory, some people won't do shit otherwise. But what if you can prove that you will do shit?   (I'm now in college btw, so it is better)"
Saiyanobe_23,27,I struggled with socialize and make friends since I was young.

Does anyone else feel this way or is it just me talking to myself? My dad has even pointed out that I’m not mature for my age and that my 14 year old sister is more mature compared to me."
Competitive_Bid7071,16,I’ve had to deal with this nonsense from my mother for a long time now when it comes to COVID-19 and Vaccine conspiracy theories she gets from Facebook and anonymous users who message her. It’s honestly hypocritical and annoying how she thinks I’m close minded yet believes in all the rubbish from these people that she doesn’t even know well and takes everything they say at face value all the while ignoring experts who object to her conspiracy theory’s. Do you haft to deal with this at all?

Competitive_Bid7071,16,"I personally have been doing this for a long time now, I don’t know why but I just really prefer to do it over actually swearing out loud for some reason. I guess because it can sound more funny that way and because it’s so I don’t actually say the word."
Competitive_Bid7071,16,"For me personally it’s probably that a lot of them don’t use logic and or factual information when it comes to very important things like government or any social issues. I feel as if they base things more off there own feelings and selfish ambitions then they do logical or for other people. I for one base my ideas and opinions off of what I see as logically the smartest things to promote or pass as policy legislation, unlike what Neurotypicals have done recently which has lead to the climate crisis and it’s effects were feeling through the various Forrest fires, droughts, and heat pockets over areas where that naturally is not supposed to occur all because there selfish and care more about money then other humans.  There emotional thinking has also lead to the rise of conspiracy cults like QAnon and Trumpism to spread into various institutions and lead to lots of people not being critical thinkers and making any smart logical decisions, but rather base it on there emotions and other silly reasons which I find ridiculous to believe is even possible. All and all it’s just really stressful for me to try to comprehend how they can possibly be like this in a time of crisis, and not bother thi thing about the consequences of there actions.   It makes me see them as emotionless and uncaring sociopath who are too egotistical and selfish to even care about others. And for me is Hypocritical as they think we don’t see “grey area” yet they are exactly how they describe us. It’s nothing but mental projection on there part."
foooood4thought,13,"I used to obsess on phone cases. Watching drop test videos. Finding the best military grade case.   I did a similar thing with phone battery life. I bought 3 spare batteries and 3 spare chargers for my old Samsung phone.  Try to think about these things, like the autistic “tin can stacking” phenomena. Look on Wikipedia of the autistic boy stacking up the tin cans, higher and higher.  You can keep building layer after layer of phone cases, like stacking the tin cans higher and higher. Or, just be more careful with your phone.  The best way to secure a phone, is to carefully place it in your pocket.  To switch pockets if you are sitting near the car window, so that it’s in the opposite pocket. So it doesn’t crack against the wall.  To hold the phone with 2 hands.  To put down any bags you are holding, on the floor. To then take the phone out of your pocket, with 2 hands, do your task. Then put the phone back in your pocket. Pick up the bags.  Dyspraxia often goes with autism. People with dyspraxia often overlap tasks.  Such as, clumsily drag phone out of pocket, while barely holding your bag with a few fingers. Then the bus driver stops to let you off. Then you lack the social skills to ask the bus driver to wait a while as you gather belongings. Then, you drop your phone on the floor. And the phone case likely fails to protect the screen entirely.  If you are then intently waiting for the bus to stop at the right spot, then you are unable to be productive while sitting on the bus. You are then stuck in OCD-style checking behaviour. Obsessively listening out for the right bus stop. You are obsessively watching for the right bus stop, in case you somehow accidentally miss it, then have to scramble together your phone, bags etc.  The correct procedure is to take your time, and communicate with the bus driver. If you take your time, you will surely not drop your phone.  Thus, the solution is, you don’t need a phone case at all. You just need to be more careful with your phone. You need to simply communicate to the bus driver, to give you a while to gather your belongings. If the bus driver doesn’t hear you, speak louder, wave your arms, ask other passengers to help you communicate the message.  Also note, autism and allergies. Phone cases can contain rubber, and latex. I personally was getting pins and needles and numbness, from simply holding my phone case. I took off the phone case, leaving nothing but the phone. Sure enough, the allergy went away.  Autism and phone cases. A fascinating topic."

joost666,7,"Is solipssims true?  Aren't we just machines? We seem to think that there is something like ""humanity"". However, everything is explainable by biology and it is input, brain processing, output. We are like complex preprogrammed robots. Should I knowing that I'm a machine still listen to the feeling of caring for others? Maybe it would benefit me more if I didn't do that: sociopathy by choice. I could also ignore being hurt, because I know it's just a brain signal. But pleasure seems meaningless too then, because that is also just a signal in the mind...  Is there a God? I don't know. Why do people believe without evidence? Seems weird. Just because your upbringing makes you believe, doesn't mean you can't think logical about it.   We all want happiness right? Why not have some device that constantly gives us happiness hormones/drugs? Or at least gives us more happiness when suffering. Then suffering wouldn't be suffering, because we would still feel happy/happier during it. Working hard in a bad job? No problem, you feel happy enough so you can do it. Relative died? , you miss them rationally, because you think about all the things you did together, but the device regulates it enough that you don't have to be hurt by it.   Where are we going after death? If we look scientifically, we are sort of machines that stop working when they die, so I'd say nowhere. But maybe this is just all an illusion and maybe life is a test on the road to somewhere else.   I don't really have the answers to all these questions that popup. I wish there was a God I could talk to, then he could explain it to me."

foooood4thought,13,"Has anyone here ever done computer programming specifically using the Adobe Flash software?  I had an autistic obsession in my teenage years, of making Flash games, and movies, using Adobe Flash.  I feel like this software is literally a mirror image of how the autistic brain works.  Frames, movie clips, object-oriented programming.  Not just that, but even software like, VirtualBox, where you can virtualise an operating system. And you can ""save state"" on any VirtualBox and come back to it later.  I feel like the autistic brain is like VirtualBox, and imagine if you had unlimited hard drive space, and unlimited CPU power, to the point where, every split second, you can ""save state"" in VirtualBox. When you ""save state"", it saves the current state of the OS, shuts down the software, and then you can open it up again. But imagine if your computer was so powerful, that you could run this ""save state"" command every single second, and thus, you can revert back to any given state of the OS. That's autism.   Or, simply the concept in video games, of being able to pause a game, and come back to it later.  I'm sure that this is why autistic people love stuff like programming, video games, VirtualBox. It is the ability to freeze precisely what you are doing and come back and re-run it.  The autistic brain is like a computer simulation brain. It's like the ultimate creative brain, that wants to re-run the same scenarios again and again, but change one parameter here or there, and then you get a new simulation."

foooood4thought,13,"I read that autistic people can have phobia of buttons.  It then occurred to me, that applying for jobs involves wearing a shirt and suit, which have buttons on them.  What if the real reason autistics don’t like working jobs, is due to phobia of the buttons on their suits?"

joost666,7,"NT'S seem to automatically process new information if I look from my perspective.   If I watch a complex series/movie plot, I have to process while watching what is happening, because otherwise I can't keep up. Also if I stop watching, the next time I have to recall it all again, actively with effort.   It seems NT'S don't have to do this. They can just watch and effortless understand what's happening. The next time they watch continue watching a series they recall everything instantly or in not much time.   It's the same having conversations. I need to pause, process and then I can give the best response. Their brain just does everything automatically: listening, then processing instantly and also forming a response instantly.   Is there a way to train this automatic processing so that I can preserve energy?"
Saiyanobe_23,27,"My dad is honestly right that I am myself to blame for not having friends or trying to get friends my own age to hang out with, because my family constantly nags on me why I don’t have people my own age to talk to and why I always have to bother my younger siblings who clearly have friends their own age."
joost666,7," I was afraid of failing in school, because if you have to resit, the learning for the resit must be done while also learning for the next subjects. I didn't want to have to deal with that because this could result in even more resits, so I got this perfectionist mentality of succeeding everything on the first try. The problem with this, is that I didn't enjoy the studying itself anymore. I just wanted to reach the end goal as soon as possible.   This mentality shifted to everything in my life. Now that it is vacation, It is lowering again. But I still often have it.   So my question is:  How do you enjoy things without stressing about the  longterm effort that is needed?   Examples: when playing a game, I sometimes am like: this is going to take a long time to complete and then I don't want to do it. It will also get in the way of other things. The same with software projects and piano pieces. I just result to watching anime/movies/series/YouTube.    I know that if humans did have endless vacation and we also lived infinitely, this problem wouldn't exist. If the future is endless and there is no work, then you can do anything in one go or when you want, without any possible blokkades in the future.   How do you focus on only the journey and not be discouraged by the longterm effort?"

SpektrumKid,2,"I know that's a very broad general question, but I realized that I always liked it better when there were a clear framework for the 'hangout' and with a game it's pretty clear what is happening and what the rules are, and everything you say to each other online is mostly about the game.  But I worry about being bullied as a lot of people don't talk nice to strangers, and I have a bad way of taking things very much to heart, and I would hate to get discouraged.  Are there any 'safe' games to socialize by online?"

SpektrumKid,2,"I guess that's an OK question? Or is it like asking a gay person, 'how bad is it?'. I couldn't figure out if I should be offended, or if it was just a natural way of asking how impeded I am because of it.  EDIT: It's my first time dating openly as autistic. (I was undiagnosed for 40 years)"
AspiringBiotech,6,It’s so fucking hard always feeling so close but yet so far…things seem just within reach and then it all just fucking goes to shit. Trying not to be angry with/frustrated by women but it just feels like they have all of the dating power (at least when it involves a relationship with me). It all just feels so unfair.
SpektrumKid,2,"Does anyone else relate to this? It's like my brain can literally only do one thing at a time. I can't feel my body fully unless my brain is empty, and if there's too much stuff happening, I just never get back to myself."
joost666,7,"I will graduate in 1.5 years and then I will get a job.   If you have to work/study, cook, clean and more there is little time and/or energy left to enjoy yourself, I noticed at an internship.   I already thought about  cooking for 4 days and storing it in the fridge, when I will be living alone. So that's one way to get more time.  But what about coming home from work/school and having no energy? Then I would watch TV(if I even have energy for that) , eat and go to bed. I feel like I lose in life because of this, the college/working system destroys my joy this way.   Then, when it's weekend, you still have to do things like cleaning, washing clothes, hanging clothes, cooking, because then you have energy for this, you can't be fully free, even on the free days.   The enjoyment from work/study alone is not enough because it's still something that has to be done to survive. It is not that I want to work, I see it as giving part of my life for freedom. But if this drains my energy so much, there won't be enough freedom."
Saiyanobe_23,27,Idk maybe it’s just me but sometimes I feel like my family gives me false hope and I end up overthinking about it everyday.
Saiyanobe_23,27,Usually high functioning autistic people and Aspies are confused for someone who’s either a sociopath or a psychopath. Is it due to the lack of emotion and expression because a lot of Aspies like ourselves have trouble showing that towards other. I saw a Reddit post on relationship advice on a 20 year old girl who was most likely autistic being called a sociopath by her boyfriend. However when I read more of her post and the comments her behavior was more of someone with autism than someone with sociopathy.
AspiringBiotech,6,"“I enjoyed our time together. Thanks for coming! I’m sorry I was being so repetitive and forgetful.

I think you’re a pretty awesome person.”"
SpektrumKid,2,"It's not just any oat meal it's, full of fresh fruit and nuts and all sorts of stuff. If I made it myself it wouldn't be anywhere near close. And you can say, it's 'just oatmeal, eat something else'... but it's taken me days to get my stomach used to a new regime and it has been working super well. I'm upset that now the established pattern will be broken and I'll have a hard stool tomorrow :(  But I guess it's good for something. It's made me realize that I need to be able to feed myself without relying on other people. I need to learn to cook for myself, but that includes grocery shopping, and that's a whole new nightmare.  I guess eventually I'll have to grow my own food, so I'm not dependent on other people to function. It's becoming a daily stress factor how to get fed, and which place to go or how to do it, that's the least sensory impactful.   Society is not designed for me."
Competitive_Bid7071,16,Honestly it’s quite refreshing for me to finally see a movie this summer. We’ve haven’t been at a theater since may and it’s gonna be nice to finally go back and see a movie again. Also if anyone’s curious it’s that new movie called “Old.”
SpektrumKid,2,"Now the pandemic has ravaged most of the world, and still is, all my social structures are gone. I used to meet a friend for coffee at the same place for 5-6 years. Because everything smelled the same, looked the same, felt the same and sounded the same.... it was incredibly easy for me to appear normal. I could engage in conversation, have banter and really good connecting moments.  But I realize now that all that is gone, how much I depended on it. Depended on most of the world around me in my environment was based on patterns I had already identified and gotten comfortable with. It was to the point that minor disruptions could be tolerated. Like if my friend were late, I could accommodate it. Or if the sun was particular bright. I could ignore it. Because nothing else was stressing my brain out, because it was basically going on idle just check marking that everything seemed normal."
joost666,7,"When watching movies, series, anime or playing games I can turn the logical side off from being too much. I just feel and enjoy it. But when dealing with real life situations my reasoning side seems to dominate everything. I think is because of a deep desire to seek the real truth behind things. The facts.   Others have these values like: everyone matters, they want to have a big impact on the world, they want to do work for others because of this. They don't want the world go to shit. They care about future generations. They care about contributing to society.   But I see many inconsistencies with this:  How can strangers matter if I don't have build up a relationship with them? I don't have a real connection with them like with friends, parents and brother. It won't matter if millions of strangers on the other side of the planet die.   Why should I also do work for these people? The only reason I see is to survive.  If I can't  care about strangers, it doesn't  matter that future generations die. The world can just go to shit after me and my loved ones die, no problem.  Why is slavery wrong? None of my loved ones are slaves.  Killing someone is not bad to me, if it is not a loved one. And more...   So in conclusion, I don't really care about the world except my loved ones because I see some inconsistencies with caring. I do care in the sense that I feel it, but the contradictions go against this.    The problem with these thoughts is that my passion and meaning in life decreases because of it. If I don't care about the world and only about loved ones, but my job contritubes to people outside of it, I won't have much drive to do it, like others.   I also can't enjoy studying for as much as others, because I don't have the drive to learn big things like others, to contribute, because of this lack of caring about the world and society.   Does anyone have similar experiences?"

joost666,7,"I've been doing 3,5 years of a IT degree. I managed, but not without heavy cost.   We get 2 chances per asignment/project/test. But If you have to go for the second chance you are doing work while still having to do other work too/sometimes work from new next subjects. That's why I constantly pushed myself to pass on the first time. It was exhausting.   I also feel like I didn't learn enough. I did learn everything temporary like just loading it into my memory and then passing the project/asigment/test. Because that seems the only way to do it.  I have never been given the time to reflect on things until now. Everything had to go fast because of what I described above, but you also only have so many weeks anyway.   While I'm still stuck on something like the big O of merge sort, the lessons go on. The test nears closer. I passed the test but I still didn't understand it. I understand it enough now. But  I am annoyed about not getting the answer sooner. They won't however wait for you when you are stuck.   I am afraid there are many things like this I was stuck  and now I am afraid that I don't know enough to tackle the real work. There are entire subjects like for example operating system that I have forgotten entirely or maybe never even really learned, just temporary.   For example, the thing I remember with operating systems: an operating system is a resource manager and a control program. But we had way more and it's gone now, like how scheduling is done. It's the same for example with embedded systems and assembly.   In general, I know only a tiny bit and not the specifics that we handled of the subjects. It is literally gone. If I try to look it up again, it's not like ""Oh yes, I remember it all"". Only tiny bits, I remember.   Examples:  Assembly: low level language that is 1:1 with machine code. How to write it again? Don't know, have to look it up.   Networking: I used to be able to state the whole TCP messaging, I could  also make subnets , now I don't know anymore. I didn't choose the networking direction in year 2, but this is just an example. I forget everything and remember the big picture.    What's the point in going specific and detailed, if I will forget it anyway? Just give the big picture only then, if that's only what I will remember!   Now I'm supposed to do an internship? Even if I've forgotten so much?  I wish they would just give us the subjects and say to us: figure it out by yourself, no time limit. It would for example learn operating systems fully until I know everything and then move on, instead of just barely having it in my head and then already having to do the next subject.    Isn't the point of learning to really practice consistently ? Instead of just shoving it in my head."

poke000,29,"I appreciate justice as much as the next person, but I don't understand the idea of trying to get back at someone.  I don't understand because there's no benefit to it.  Like, it doesn't actually help the person who's trying to impose justice through their eye-for-an-eye mentality.  All it does is create a pointless cycle where everyone loses.  One reason it may not be truly fair is that the original offense may be more innocent that perceived.  *For example*, at work, I was sent a message that I saw right as I was leaving for an important appointment.  I intended to respond right after I got back, but my mind was still preoccupied on my appointment and I forgot.    Now this person seems to not respond to my messages.  I don't know for sure if this is an eye-for-an-eye thing, since they might just be really busy.  But for arguments sake, let's say it is.  Would it be a right or fair response?

I have never seen them and don't know if they are nice.   I have emotions that  conflict this logical thought my empathy works like normal. But I try to push them away because it seems just too much of a contradiction.   Everyone else around also seems to want to make the world better for everyone. But I just can't understand that. They have this big idea that the world must be fixed and everyone matters. But how can I care about billions of people if I don't know them?   Shouldn't I want the world to only be good for people I care about? Also, why must I care about the next generations? Why do people think it's good to advance humanity? Why do people want the earth to not be harmed if they only live for a short while? Caring about billions of future people seems just weird. Again, I don't know them and have built no relationship with all of them.    People also relativate to others. ""You should be thankfull, in other parts of the world they have it way worse"". But why care about those people? Again no relationship with them and no build up emotions over time.     2. Family system   My family outside of brother and parents expects me to care about them, talk to them and go to family meetings. But I did not ever build a relationship with them. My parents just dragged me along with them.   I  did not choose them as people I want to be friends with. Still, they expect me to. The way I see it: I meet someone, built a connection with them overtime and that way I care about them. That's how I form bonds. But I didn't ever to do that with family and feel like I don't have to. They are just strangers to me basically, which know my parents and care about them. I want to treat them as friends of my parents and nothing else.   Still, they have this insisting of going closer to me than that.   Why hang out with people just because of the same surname and/or genetics?    3. The point in life when my life isn't my own.   ""You can become anything"", they say. I don't want to be something. I don't want to go years to school, work and die. That is just being a cog in the society.  if I don't work however, I'd be homeless. My life is not my own, the will to not be on the street is in control of my life.   I want to enjoy life without having to work that much. I never signed a contract at birth stating that the deal was to work all my life.   ""Find something you love and you won't have to work"" , is often what people say. But it isn't as easy as that. Even if you really like something, you will still have struggles. There is also social interactions, coworkers, deadlines and more.   It would be okay if the work/school and free time was equally distributed. So 365/2 days a year work/school and also this same amount of days free time. This would be fair. It would be a trade: trading half of my life for the same amount of freedom. But it doesn't work that way.   I will try to get a job that is as part-time as possible after graduating, so that I can still live the life I want. But if I can't manage this, I don't see the point to continue. I won't end life if that happens, but I will have lost in life. The society system will have won. My life will be truly not mine anymore.   The result is that I will try to get as much pleasure in the free time as I can, to make up for work. This could result in severe substance abuse or early death. I already eat a lot of unhealthy things and am trying to escape constantly because my life is being dictated by the will to graduate, to learn enough for the job and not be on the streets.   Also, I want more free time not only because I want to have a fair trade, , but also because life is overwhelming with change and I want things to stay the same. I would never stress again about performance, I never want to have to do anything hard. If I could a find a job that's mundane, not hard and boring work that I could for 3 days a week, it would all be okay becuase I'd know I won't ever do anything wrong, wouldn't have to grow anymore and could just relax the other 4 days of the week.  The problem is: most mundane, not hard, boring jobs I see  don't pay that well, ofcourse."

Nicenastybuttercup,19,"When I’m alone, with family, or with someone I’m really comfortable with, I don’t really emote with my face. I only just realized this after having a full time job for a while and I realized that I’m flexing my face so I don’t look like a bitch. I literally have to activate muscles in my face to force a friendlier neutral expression   People who are close to me always think I’m mad or somethings wrong when my face is neutral because of this reason. But it just means I’m comfortable with the person."

joost666,7,"Example: my parents bought a puppy when we already have a dog. The cat is afraid of the first dog because it reacted wildly because of sound, so the cat doesn't come inside anymore. We try to lock her in every time she came for food but it will take a while for her to feel safe again to stay home. And now my parents bought another puppy. So then I think: it might worsen the situation. It also barks really a lot because it has to stay in a cage as a puppy for rest.    It is like NT'S can't ever see consequences when trying to throw in a change. It's a ""It's going to be okay even though we are not sure it will work out mentality"" .   How do you deal with this type of mentality?  They also do this with expectations: ""Do this big thing"". Me in my head: ""but what if this happens"" . Or: ""that's impossible"". But they still expect it from me.   It is the same with internships that I have to do in college:  they expect me work at a big project of 20 weeks, even though I have no work experience. Also, what if I don't have enough knowledge? What if I don't finish in time?  So again, NT'S want  things even though there is no guarentee that it will work out.      If they would have a solution for every possible problem,  then I would I would have no stress. But they don't think that way.   With the internship they could say to me: if you don't have enough knowledge that's no problem because you can still show what you've learned.   Or: If you don't finish in time the project was just to be big, so we'll just examine how far you've come.  But they don't say such things. They don't give you a list reasurements for possible problems in the future. You just have to guess on it. Some possible problems don't even seem to come into their head.   And then I'm getting stressed out because I see all these possible problems with no answers to them.   Loosening the Corona rules is also such ""It will be OK even if not sure"" mentality. Now, due to the loosening the infection rate is going up again. I get everyone wants to connect socially but just wait longer until it's 100% over. Then you have the least casualties.   I just prefer a ""It will be OK, because I know as a fact it will be OK"" mentality. It seems to have the best results most lot of the time. To me me, everybody around me is just guessing and hoping."

Saiyanobe_23,27,I’m 19 and I haven’t interacted with any girls my own age since I was 17 which was two years ago before COVID happened. This made me feel lonely because usually there’s always a guy my age that has at least one friend that is a girl and actually hangs out with them and talk to me. I feel embarrassed because I am a fully grown adult who doesn’t even interact with any girl. How can I meet girls and where can I meet them at? When I go outside to take small walks I barely even see any people except for cars driving by which is weird.
poke000,29,"Growing up I had all the problems you'd expect from being on the spectrum, but at one point I decided I wanted to focus on self development.  What if I could not only be as stable as my NT family members-- What if I could become more stable?  All I needed was structure and routine.  Over time I became stable and healthy on every level-- financially, physically, mentally, socially (though that last one is contingent on keeping social interactions to a minimum).    But now I feel like I don't relate to other humans.  I look at them and all I see are unhinged, broken people making decisions based more off emotions than rational thought.    My sister, for example, is trying to have another baby, and with what I know about her financial situation, this is a terrible idea.  She thinks everything will just ""work out"", but if she sat down and planned for the long term, she'd see that this is very unwise.  See? Now I feel like a freakin' android.  Beep beep emotions are... illogical. Does not compute."
joost666,7,"Can you just turn anxious thoughts off? I would be invincible if I could. Everytime I try to do something, like talk to someone I don't know well, this voice says: ""what if"" + something else.  Examples:  ""what if he/she finds it weird I don't look her in the eye?"" ""what if I don't finish the asigment in time? “ "" what if I cannot communicate good enough with that person? “  Or when trying to ask for help: ""what if they think I'm stupid?""  At internship: ""what if they are busy? They look really busy""  One coping mechanism is to ask for validation on my what ifs. Example with ""what if they are busy? “  When can I ask a question?  Or with the eye contact I can explain.   But it does never stop the endless stream of what ifs.  It just deals with them. But new ones popup shortly after that."
SpektrumKid,2,"I had finally found a way to relax my entire body from years of trauma, so I took a long walk this morning and found myself in soho where I rested on a stoop. Great weather this morning.  But then as I'm daydreaming this guy comes up in my face (without shirt, nor mask) and yells if he can ask me a question. I quickly get up, turn and walk briskly away. But I have a sense he's right behind me, but I don't dare to look. So I get to the corner of broadway... and then I realize he's right behind me... so I sprint. and he runs after....  I've never run so fast in my life. I think I traversed a block in less than 8 seconds. But maybe time dilates when you're stressed.  I managed to get away from him, but it was a little intense. I can't relax my back anymore but I'm sure I'll regain that.  I was mugged when I was 10.  Then scammed in London when I was 21.  And then attempted mugged in Soho when I was 32.  and now again, in soho when I'm 43.  I guess I'll be mugged again (attempted maybe) when I'm 54? If the pattern are gonna fit?

SpektrumKid,2,"I got diagnosed 3 almost 4 years ago now. It's been a crazy ride as I've read people say, but it's really down to this forum and you guys. This place is the antithesis to the usual bile and venom you see on social media. This place, you guys, are the most supportive group of people on the planet.   A very human need amongst being fed and staying warm, is 'being seen' and 'being understood'.   I've craved being understood my whole life, and never got it. Until I came here.  Finding this forum was like finding my home.  My neurotypical friend always told me: ""You need to find your peers"", and I always thought to myself ""Who the hell are my peers?"". I couldn't think of a single person I felt I could relate to in a real way my whole life.  Until I came here. You helped me find myself, and I will carry the torch forward to help enlighten other people about their true beautiful nature.   Love you all."
Saiyanobe_23,27,"So many NTs in my life have clowned and made fun of me just because I thought have the same thought process as them, well sorry my brain is just wired differently compared to y’all."
joost666,7,"When I was younger I could do so much more, I enjoyed life, was interested in all sorts of things.   Now I want to stay inside in my room all day, never wanting new things. I just do gaming, programming, watching movies and series and playing piano.    Also, since I felt the heaviness of growing up, I've become more sensitive to stimuli. My overanalyzing, stress and anxiety has grown too. I shut myself more and more in. I've become addicted to the hobbies with screens too. Watching Netflix late at night and feeling tired the next morning.   I wish I could just skip to the part of life where I have everything in order, no more uncertainty. Just the daily basic needs covered without any effort because of routine.   I desperately desire such final destination first before going out of this sameness.

And the other side planning for the future, trying to be practical, tactical and strategic.   How do I reconcile those two half’s? Like Bruce Banner/Smart Hulk in End Game?

Nicenastybuttercup,19," Removed as a separate diagnosis*  Opinions are definitely welcome down below and I definitely get not wanting to stigmatize people and hold people back from a full inclusion classroom, but what about the people who were high functioning but still could’ve used the help? There are so many geniuses in the 70% unemployment rate (my family is affected by this personally), that I believe services during the preschool and elementary age for even high functioning pwApsergers could have had a drastic impact.  For me personally, I am NT passing but (pending diagnosis) on the spectrum but I literally am paying for physical therapy in my early 20’s.

Saiyanobe_23,27,"I think this needs to be said but this whole entire society just isn’t meant for any of us. It’s so hard to socialize and fit in with the crowd. Also tasks that are easy for NTs are often hard for us. I read a Reddit post a while ago stating that suicide is often higher in people with ASD and that assisted suicide is eligible in other countries for people with ASD. It’s hard to communicate with others and it’s hard to find normal jobs, drive a car, start a business, start an relationship. and get cards. I wonder if people with ASD also have trouble relating to other people with ASD."
poke000,29,"I made a post in the AITA sub and some people said I was unprofessional, but I don't understand how.

SpektrumKid,2,"I remember my early childhood, and how every year was another victory lap of learned skills. Like when I mastered the bike, by going in circles for 20 minutes straight. Or when I finally figured out shoelaces. When I learned new words, and started making sentences. All those victories. It was super fun, developing. But then ... it kind of stopped. Around 13 I think emotionally I stalled, because that feeling of 'developing' just disappeared. I didn't feel like I was leveling up anymore.  It's only now looking back, that I can pinpoint when it happened. Because up until then, I remember being excited about the next year (and what skills I might learn). But then I stopped being excited, because nothing else happened.  I still sucked being social or around other people, and still do today. It's fair to say that I stopped growing when I was 13. I guess I just only really realized it now, and I'm ok with not punishing myself for it. I was just never meant to :)"

poke000,29,"I've heard a stereotype where ASD people say inappropriate things at inappropriate times. But I think this may be due to NTs misunderstanding.  For example, I once called me Dad and told him I was having a very tough time, and I stated, *""My body doesn't work.""*  He quickly dismissed it and moved on as if I said something he really didn't want to talk about. I realized later that he probably thought I meant it in a... weird way.  Why would he think I'd actually call him and say something that overtly sexual?? I was obviously talking about how my entire body-- respiratory system, digestion, etc. seemed to be on the fritz.  But in the NT mind, body = sex stuff.  It's like that is all they think about."

Why am I also angry about it? Well, before I learned these skills, everyone treated me like an asshole.  I was not an asshole.  I wanted to live in harmony with everyone.  No matter how people treated me, I wanted to get along with them.  I was never petty, or vindictive, or hateful.  I had empathy for people, but I didn't communicate that in a way that they could understand it.  I haven't become a ""better"" or more empathic person-- the only change was communication skills.  If anything I am now more manipulative! hehehe  **Yet they treat me better, which highlights how badly I was treated before.  It shows that they were judging me as a bad person when I was just a person who communicated differently.** If they had the same mindset that I had-- to live harmoniously with others-- they would have treated me with respect and common courtesy regardless of how well I communicated.  It's like their thought process is, ""Well I don't enjoy being around this person, so I'll go ahead and treat them like trash.""  How does that help anything?  *Honestly, I think the average NT is every bit as broken as the average ND.*"

If you can't get a good view of the full picture of a person, you'll just get lost in details that are not defining them specifically.  I don't know, I'm rambling. But I feel like I'm basically blind to people. I see obstacles in the street that I recognize are shaped like organisms that resemble people. Even when I get to know someone, my thinking is that I only know a fraction, and don't have enough data to get a complete picture.  Is it the lack of 'complete picture' that makes it hard to relate to people or 'see' them as 'persons' ?  It's like no matter how hard I look, I only see one detail at a time, but never the whole person. Does anyone else relate to this?"
SpektrumKid,2,"I've started employing a new tactic. Whenever I face myself being hard on myself about something, it's reasonable to think I'm actually judging myself too hard, and to that I say to myself:  ""Who are you to judge?""  It kind of makes the 'judge' part of my brain become self conscious, and the staggered moment can be used to turn it off.  It's only worked once, but I just wanted to share it. Maybe it can help someone."
Competitive_Bid7071,16,I mean the amount of people I know and or talk to on here is ASTOUNDING to say the least.

SpektrumKid,2,"I realize I was mostly pursuing it because I was made fun of by my sister for not dating or appearing gay. And since my first girlfriend broke up with me I have been on a non stop 20 year quest to get a new one. Then later I got diagnosed and now I know why it was so hard, but also why I coveted that status so much: I wanted to prove to be normal.   But I ain’t. And honestly, the mental anguish of trying to overcome something but failing for two decades…. I have other things to do with my time.   And honestly I don’t think I ever truly wanted one. It was really mostly so I could relax about being weird. But I can do that now already because I know what and who I am.   No reason to stress about it.   From today I’m changing my prime directive from: ‘~~Get Girlfriend’~~  To  ‘Make yourself happy’  Much better goal."
Saiyanobe_23,27,Does autism develop differently in girls compared to guys? I noticed the only people I have met in my life who were autistic were all guys I never met a girl who was autistic. What is the difference between a girl and a guy with autism? I read a post somewhere on Reddit that women/girls with autism are more undiagnosed than men/guys.
foooood4thought,13,"I'm pretty sure that I have autism myself.   And I don't understand how it's possible to not be able to read someone's facial expressions.  For those who struggle to read facial expressions, what do you possibly mean by this?  Can you not see that a ""U"" shape is a smile? Or a ""n"" shape is unhappy? Or a ""-"" shape is neutral? Or rolling the eyes upwards is a sarcastic displeasure or mocking? Or that a wink of the eye is a thing like, sarcastically implying something or mocking?  Are you saying that you literally cannot see the ""U"" shape in a mouth, like a hallucination where the lips disappear into the face skin? Or are you saying that you don't know what a ""U"" shape would mean, as in, how can you tell if they are smiling or chewing food? Or what?  I think it's quite possible that I might fail to care about people's facial expressions, as in, autistic people are more interested in analysing things than people. But I do think that I can definitely see their facial expressions, and understand when someone is on the verge of crying, shouting, smiling, frowning, etc.   It's possible that I might have never learned more subtle social cues, like hand movements, gestures, implied speech, and that I can take speech too literally.  But I simply have no idea how it's possible to not be able to tell when someone is sad. For example, the YouTuber ""The Aspie World"" said in a video that he cannot actually tell when someone is sad. I simply don't understand how that is even possible, to not be able to tell if someone is sad. Surely autistic people are good with shapes and patterns and could very quickly detect changes in the shape of someone's mouth, eyes, cheeks etc?"
Saiyanobe_23,27,Does anyone else ever dream about things that never seem to happen in your life? I always day dream about my false life every single day because my real life is pretty boring and one dimensional.

joost666,7,"I only know the the software engineering basics from college, but we are supposed do two internships. For the first, I need to do a 20 week one.   I feel like I barely know anything.  What if I don't come far? What if I'm not there yet in skill? A lot of the vacancies ask for all sorts of techniques I don't know, and it seems that they have challenging internship assignments. I'm scared that I will barely be able to do anything.   I want work to be something that I do in order to survive. But they seem to be expecting someone whose life is about coding only.  Any Aspies that have had these feelings too?  I already burned  out at a previous internship due to this stress. Also, due to the expectations of college and the expectations in the internship not colliding and too much unclarity on the assignment. I tried asking for clarification, but didn't get any wiser.  It also didn't work well that I had to work 40 hours, which was a sudden energy and that college told us ""find an internship as soon as possible"". So I was crashing while I had to do other school work too. It turned out that I didn't have to take that literally. A lot of people found an internship just before the deadline. The deadline even got set back by students contacting that they hadn't found anything, while I was stressing weeks before that, because they said I had to find one as soon as possible. So I already went into the internship with a lot of stress."
foooood4thought,13,"I recently learned about air humidity. It is supposed to be 30-50% relative humidity (RH) for maximum comfort.   I bought a measuring device and found the RH in my room to be 60%, which is way higher.  This kind of stuff is going to get even worse in the summer.  Everybody knows about noise as a problem for autistic people. And some autistic people don’t like being touched either. Some may over-react to smell or have no sense of smell at all. Some have light sensitivity issues with their eyes. Some may only like the texture of certain foods or taste.  These are the traditional 5 senses. Touch, taste, sound, smell, vision.  But it recently occurred to me that room humidity may be a huge issue.  I found that I like to spend time outdoors, and I suspect that this is simply due to the fresh air.  You can buy an electric a dehumidifier device that collects air humidity and either pumps it out continuously through a hose, which you might, say, have flowing all day down the bath tub. Or, you can also have it collect the water in a box that is a set size, e.g. 5 litres.  These devices may be difficult for autistics because they can make a lot of noise. The devices also require maintenance, such as I believe, sucking out the dust that builds up, and we are not good at things like daily cleaning, maintenance tasks etc.  There is also another option, called an oxygen concentrator. It generates quality oxygen, and you hook it up to a small mask which sits just under your nose and generates air. I have read that this is not recommended for too much time because you are only supposed to have 21% oxygen naturally present in air, and anything above or below can cause problems.  Has anyone ever bought either a dehumidifier or an oxygen concentrator. What brand name did you buy and what were your experiences with these devices? Did they help ease depression or improve clarity of thinking?"
joost666,7,"My whole life I can only smell things if I put it directly in front of my nose or sniff deeply. So, when I'm eating, I don't smell the food.  They say you don't taste much if you don't smell, but my taste is really good. I like food.   Does anybody else have this lack of smell but still good taste?"
SpektrumKid,2,"so apparently I took a backup of my brain at every ‘apocalyptic event’ meaning, anything that damaged my growth. Causing a branch of development to be burnt off.   I took a backup of my trauma or more specifically, exactly what I was thinking and how I was feeling at the time. But not directly… simply by at the moment of trauma thinking: this is not gonna be good for my development, I should remember this moment.   So by doing that at every traumatic event, I gave myself a bread crumb trail to follow back to the origin. Since I have photographic memory, I can remember thinking that thought a lot when I was kid. I made it a routine, to take a mental snapshot of the moment, so I could go back later, to process it.   I knew exactly who I was, when I was 3 years old. Everything else, has been a mask I had to wear, in order to survive. People like me, don’t survive, unless we pretend to be normal.   I have no idea how I was that cognizant of how helpful this data would be 30 years later, but apparently I at least instinctively started thinking these things from the age of 3. I haven't changed at all really. At least not the way I think."

joost666,7,"I want to be in school and work the same amount of hours as I am free. I'm in school still and until now it hasn't happened. We go to school a lot more then we are free. You could compensate with retirement, but there is no guarantee you will live that long or longer.   You have to do subjects in all schools that you know you will never want to do anything with. But you still are forced these subjects. Time of my life was stolen this way.   In highschool, I knew I learned better at home, still I had to go to school. I learned less by doing that. I also lost a lot of energy and/or happiness that I never got back.   Parents care for you a lot, that is something I can't ever all give back exactly in amounts.    I get especially angry at these above mentioned things like hours of work/school VS freedom, energy invested VS energy won, negative emotions VS positive emotions and more things that could have a 1:1 ratio, totally balanced. It does not work that way.  I know I can't control it, somethings somewhat but not all. It is eating me up. I have a strong need for things to be optimal.   Also other unfair things, that I can't do anything about:  Everyone is expected to learn at the same speed, because the test/assignment due dates are the same. However, not everyone learns at the same speed.   (I study software enginering)   Not everyone programs at the same speed, but the programming tests still have a time limit. A lot of classmates and me did not finish in time often on these tests.   Googling is not allowed on programming tests, even though in the real world you use it a lot.   There are people that are rich who didn't have to work. They can do whatever they want. I want that too.   I don't like communicating with people, but I'm expected to do it all the time.   The above and a lot more other things are not fair. How do you deal with it? How do you accept it? Especially the 1:1 ratio thing is a struggle for me."
AspiringBiotech,6,"Sometimes the most difficult battles we fight are internal. Realize that that voice inside your head telling you you aren’t good enough isn’t really YOUR voice.

I feel like I'm gonna owe him something, and I'm confused about the subtext? Can it be because he thinks of me as a younger brother from another mother kind of thing?  Maybe I'm just uncomfortable when people do something nice for me out of nowhere. I think I'm used to a punch in the gut, or something or other bad happens after. My experience is people always have other motives, and it makes me sad that I can't even appreciate my friend trying to show he cares for me? (If that's what the intent was?)

poke000,29,"I was diagnosed with Asperger's as a kid. I believe I might have ADHD as well, but it's almost impossible to get diagnosed as an adult without a high cost of time and money.  So I looked at the DSM-5 criteria for adult diagnosis of predominantly inattentive presentation, and it said if I fit 5 of them, I'd be considered ADHD.  In my case there were exactly 5:   1. Fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes 2. Has difficulty sustaining attention 3. Avoids or dislikes tasks requiring sustained mental effort 4. Is easily distracted 5. Is forgetful in daily activities  I do like organization though-- having structure and things like phone reminders and lists help me remember things. Without them I'd be hopeless.  I know nobody here can diagnose me, but regardless I'm going to try to diagnose myself (since it's my only option).  My question is whether or not having ASD alone would explain those symptoms."
joost666,7,"I can teach myself with the internet and creating excersizes. I will learn better that way.   School is bad for my development because I can't learn long-term in it.

When the next semester started, I always was like: ""I have used it, but still don't fully understand that thing.""  And then I would soon forget it. I feel like I have forgotten whole semesters worth of information.  I feel like I am not well prepared for the future due to this.   However, now that I am at home studying for some weeks I feel like I can really learn anything to the core.   Does anybody else have this? Why is there no self learning college?

Competitive_Bid7071,16,Personally I have a pretty huge idea I want to do as a way to help a community get more awareness publicly. Basically I want to build a bunch of Greco-Roman styled temples in my states capitol that can be used as places of worship and for various religious festivals. It’s kinda a type of activism and I personally am doing it to help others. Have you ever held similar plans?
joost666,7," First the school and work system.  Hours of your life are stolen in your youth in school , because you already know that you don't want to use some knowlede later, but still you have to. For examble  I was learning  French, German and Spanish in high school. I knew I didn't want to, but the system forced me to throw away a part of my life for grades and passing. Those and other hours are stolen and never given back, I have forgotten it now and don't want to use it ever again. They basically kill you partly. I could have done something that was useful for later like social skills, being thought how to handle stress, deal with autism or I could have graduated sooner because I could do only as much subjects as you need. Or they could have given me more free time. Pleasure is not wasted time. That's to me what life is really about.   Why can't we be free like this: when you know you never want to touch something again, allow to drop it? That way I would have wasted less of your time in life. It would  not make me hate hate school. I would also not regret the lost and stolen time. Furthermore, I would have had less hardship due to not having enough energy to be in a classroom all day, socializing being overwhelmed and learning inefficiently because the way they teach me doesn't work well for me.   I wish I could just have set my own learning schedule and my own subjects in high school, and learn in solitary.   Now I am constantly worried about not more time being stolen from my life. Because of this, I wish I just was instantly out of college, in a part time job. I want to have a job with the least possible hours, so that I can enjoy life to the fullest. I hope I can afford a job with not many hours. Otherwise the proportions are not fair and it will devastate me. I did not agree with this when I was born: to just be a property of society. They already make it a lot of aspies difficult, steal time from our youth, and then expect me to work a lot? I didn't think so.    Ideally I should only work 50% of the week, so that way for every hour I work,  I get one hour of freedom. So, ( 7*8)/2 =28 hours. But it depends on rent and job availability if I can do that.   But until I have a part time job, I have to do 2 internships of 40 hour/week. I hope I can manage.   Another system that really  does not make sense is the family system. So what if we have the same genes/birth name? I love my parents and brother and friends. Why? Because I have spent time with them. I grew up with them. But I don't understand why my parents forced/want me to visit aunts, grandma's and so on?   Let me decide who I'm friends with. Just because people have the same surname/genes  does not mean that you have to care about each other. If I meet someone in my life and I like them, I can choose to spend time with them. But with family, my parents never made me choose when I was younger. They just brought me with them.   It is not that they are not nice people, but I don't see them that often as most people that I really see as friends. So, why would I go along with them? They seem just nice strangers to me.   So now I when my parents want me to meet family, I do it for my parents. But I don't like it. If they ask if I want to go, I always say no. I only say yes if they really want me to be there. It has to come from them wanting it.  There is ofcourse also this social convention system which doesn't always make sense. A lot of aspies have to deal with this.    Examples:  - Shaking hands when you can just say hello.  - Having to thank someone even though they already know that you like what you did. Because that's what thanking is: showing that you like what someone did for you.  - It is polite to say ""can I order?"" when calling a snackbar reservation. (They already know you want to order, you are calling a snackbar)  - Saying that you are okay to the question ""how are you?"" even though you are not okay.  - Having to greet everyone with kisses at a family gathering. It is loud, they say al sorts of things really fast (like ""how are you"") and act really way too enthousiastic when they do this. I just want to get it over with everytime. I'd rather just not greet everyone and just greet when they talk to me later, or stand in a cirkel and all say hello once to the whole group.     The mentioned systems are a burden to deal with, I think.  What do you think about it? Any tips on being/becoming more happy? How do you deal with all this? Or  can you tell me similar things you have to deal with?"
Saiyanobe_23,27,"I feel like such a terrible, lazy, and socially inept person.  I don’t care if anyone sees this or this doesn’t get attention but I really need to get this off my chest. This is something I have been struggling for a long time and I have been bottling it up so I feel like typing it. I(19M) have been struggling to adjust to society for a long time. When I was younger I had terrible social skills and communication which is still relevant today. When I was in school I will always have a teacher/helper beside me to keep me on task and this had gone from elementary to high school. I graduated from high school in 2020 but my high school graduation was meaningless since afterwards I had a meltdown since my mom missed me walking up the stage.  Now imma talk about my school life my school life for most of my life was terrible but I had trouble fitting in with other kids and making friends a and I often got bullied for being quirky and socially awkward. There were times where I would have good days but for the most part it was bad when it came to school. I’m also not like people in my age group because a lot of them are in clubs, have friends, start relationships, have bank accounts, jobs, go to parties, have sex, own apartment, and drive a car. Now I will try to get myself that but I feel like it will all overwhelm me in the nearby future.   I also still have trouble with eye contact and forming genuine conversations with people so I still take speech and I have to change the tone of my voice because I have a monotone voice. This 2020-2021 year I have done nothing but stay at home with my family who I barely interact with and I haven’t even applied for college. It upsets me because I was supposed to go to a big university but I end up missing all of my freshman year of college to do nothing.   I don’t have any friends irl so I tried to gain online friends and that didn’t help me at all and it did nothing but made me more depressed than ever. Mostly due to the fact that I couldn’t understand or click with them at all. They would mostly just nitpick and not talk to me at all. I will also have random thoughts of suicide every once in a while.   This is a problem I have had with myself as a whole and idk what to do to fix myself to become a better person in the future."
Competitive_Bid7071,16,Just now my mom and brother were talking about me doing a “pose” I did at my graduation party to show I’m proud of myself and for people to see me. But since it’s from a film I like that happens to be R rated they got upset at it and said things like “dO yOu wAnT tO bE rEmEmbErEd aS A nUt cAsE!!!” Or something like that. After I left the room they started talking behind my back about me it seems. About how since I’m autistic there afraid I’m gonna “act out” bad things from films with violent scenes in them and worded it like I had a mental illness. It honestly pissed me off a lot and made me extremely disappointed in my mom and brother. Has this type of thing ever happened to you before and how do you handle these things?

AspiringBiotech,6,"I mean, who the Hell is it helping? Sure, mention problems and work on fixing them. But can we have a damn break at times? I hate 24 hours news networks. My dad keeps them on all day long and complains all the time about the world’s problems. Well, people aren’t often able to help solve any problems when they feel depressed and hopeless."
poke000,29,"I grew up Christian, but when I started questioning things and seeing the contradictions and dangers inherent in the religion, I deconverted.  I asked myself why I was the only one in my family to do it, and I think part of the answer is that it is very much a social thing.  Their entire social lives are built around it.  They are rewarded with praise from friends if they make a Facebook post about their enduring faith and love of Christ.  They can't let it go, because if they did, their lives would fall apart. It discourages them from asking questions that would turn them away from their faith.  Religion feels extremely neurotypical to me."
SpektrumKid,2,"Sometimes the tunnel vision is intense and I can experience just following one thought after the other in one long stream. If nothing interrupts me, an entire day can have passed, and I'm hardly out of bed or having eaten anything.      Does anyone else lose hours if they let themselves fall into the tunnel vision/hyper fixation?"
AspiringBiotech,6,"The “impairments in imagination” criterion , in particular, is troubling. The potential impairments include “ a lack of varied, spontaneous make believe play”, “inability to tell, write, or generate spontaneous, unscripted, or unplagiarised fiction”, or “either a lack of interest in fiction appropriate to developmental level or interest in fiction is restricted to its possible basis in fact”. According to this test, if you don’t have difficulties in these areas, you don’t have AS.   I’ve always enjoyed both Fiction and Non-Fiction growing up. I wrote short stories. I pretended to be a Ninja Turtle.  The authors of the assessment even admit that “cases of individuals with AS who are gifted at drawing, film-making, and poetry are well-documented”, yet claim that since only one symptom is required, that inclusion is warranted. Well, not all people who have AS (or High Functioning Autism, as it is now called) have any significant impairments in imagination...should they not be allowed a diagnosis and consequent access to public resources?"
Saiyanobe_23,27,"Is it true people with Aspergers/high functioning Autism have a hard time forming relationships. Relationships such as having a girlfriend, boyfriend, or best friend?"
Saiyanobe_23,27,Have any of y’all cross dressed? If so how old are y’all and what does it feel like to crossdress?
joost666,7,"I have planned in my calender a routine for showers, changing sheets and more. I have also bedtime notifications and an alarm clock for waking up. But I can't stick to all these things. I am always staying up late, because I want to still do things like watching series, and then the next morning I'm too tired to get immediately out of bed when the alarm clock rings. I also put the alarm clock one hour further.   Then when it says showering, changing sheets, or cutting nails. I often don't want to do it because there is always something or I don't have enough energy.   I just don't have the discipline to stick to the routine, even though I know it is needed.   I wish I could live without having to go to school and later to work, but I can't, because not a rich millionaire, unfortunately. Therefore I have to be able to stick to such a routine to maximize my energy.  Any help to make it easier?"
Saiyanobe_23,27,"I always speak in a monotone voice and it’s hard to change the pitch and emotion of my voice because every time I do it, it always seems so forced. Also people including my own parents have told me I look mad and have the eyes that I want to kill someone when that’s just the expression of my face. Also people have told me I sound angry and straight forward a lot, does anyone else have this problem too?"
AspiringBiotech,6,"Reading about SSRIs today for example, and I see things like this:  “down-regulation of post-synaptic 5-HT 2A receptors may contribute to antidepressant efficacy directly, or by influencing the function of noradrenergic and other neurons via serotonergic heteroreceptors”  Ok, but 1.) What is causing the downregulation? (What’s the mechanism of action?) 2.) How, exactly, are these other neurons being modulated by heterorecptors?"
poke000,29,"I usually have my Instacart order put in a basket, but this time I didn't realize that I got more cans of food than usual, and it was enough that they barely fit in the basket. The shopper had to squeeze the bags full of cans in the basket-- it took some effort to pull the paper bags up because everything was so tightly squeezed. Could this have ruptured the cans? Like if you squeezed one, would it burst around the seems?   I want to understand scientifically why I am being paranoid here-- because I will not believe they are safe based only on speculation.  I need to know."
Saiyanobe_23,27,"I just turned 19 not too long who and I feel so empty, lonely, and socially inept. Most teenagers/young adults my age usually go outside, have fun, join clubs and groups, party, drive, play sports, etc. and I just stay home doing nothing but scroll through my phone and sometimes look after my phone. I also stay in room 24/7 and most of them time I feel so depressed and bored and my mind is always in a frenzy. Recently I have been having thoughts and everything is just so complicated."
SpektrumKid,2,"I realized I have to journal every day, otherwise I can't get my thoughts out, and then it becomes like a pressure cooker. Back in the day I had a network of friends I could drop by at and just ramble all my thoughts out, and then be on my way. It was fantastic, but since the pandemic I've become the loner I always dreaded. But I have a self care plan now I think.  It seems journaling and exercise are two of the most important things in terms of keeping your mental health in check. Exercise is literally just the effects of elevating your heart rate by doing something strenuous. It doesn't actually have to be running. It just be lifting a heavy box for hours or whatever works for you. For me it's riding a bike.  But another two equally important areas is self-expression. Obviously journaling is pat of that, but I also like to draw, and compose music. What I can't express with words, I can express with music. And what I can't express with music I can express by drawing.  I think a happy aspie life is about getting all those pent up emotions processed in as many different outlets as we can.   Last but not least is your body. You really have to get in touch with all parts of it in order to appreciate you entire self. I've only spent the last year stretching, but I can reach my toes again, and without making a pun, I felt like I got grounded again. I could feel the earth under my feet again.   I don't know why I'm writing this. Just sharing my thoughts in case anyone can relate. I finally got control over my digestion and food, so that's taken care of in a routine that works."
Competitive_Bid7071,16,I have a serious problem with this sort of thing and it’s something my mom gets really annoyed by. I honestly don’t know why I tell people things me and her talked about in regard to her friends or family but it’s caused a few bumps here and there. What do you think causes this?
Competitive_Bid7071,16,"It’s been fine so far, I’ve gotten lots of nice food and I don’t need to personally stay for to long. All and all I’d say I’ve got a pretty good deal."
Saiyanobe_23,27,Has anyone on here ever gotten so upset to the point that they punch themselves repeatedly in the head and scratch themselves?  It happens to me a lot idk why but it calms me down and I just need something to take my anger out on which is myself. It only happens if I get really frustrated or angry.
Saiyanobe_23,27,How was school like for you? In Elementary school I had a special aid  beside me who would always try to keep me on task everyday. It would be a different special aid teacher every grade for me and I didn’t stop having one until 12th grade(Senior year of HS) but they always assigned me to have one.   Also I had a lot friends during elementary school but that suddenly changed when I went to middle school. Also during high school those former friends all grew up they became more mature while I felt like I remained the same which was hard for me to make friends. Ever since I finished elementary school it was hard for me to make friends because everyone in my age group changed except for me. Although I did get smarter and had more common sense but personality wise I never changed which was hard for me.
Competitive_Bid7071,16,"I honestly have mixed emotions on the whole thing, on the one hand I now have a job and can help myself and my mother is my legal guardian. But on the other hand I feel empty and sad about the whole thing. I’m never gonna see all the people I talked to or knew again and won’t be able to even see my teachers again."
urbanracer34,0,"[Here's last week's Solitude Project Saturday](https://old.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/nikw1u/solitude_project_saturday_what_projects_are_you/)  **So, /r/aspergers, what projects do you have on the go right now?

poke000,29,"My favorite people to talk with are people who care as much as I do about clearly transmitted messages.    I think clarity is very important in conversations.  I don't want to waste my energy speaking if my words are going to be interpreted incorrectly.  I think the best way to do that is by asking questions.  If I don't know what a person means, I will usually say something like, ""Wait when you say X, do you mean Y or Z?""  It does depend on the relationship of the two people speaking of course.  If I'm talking to someone I'm close to, like my parents, I will always try to clarify what they say.  It drives me crazy when they don't do me the same courtesy. It's like they think any question would be too intrusive, so they just GUESS what I'm trying to say.  It inevitably causes misunderstandings and I hate it!"
joost666,7,"I am scared of assuming things. For example, when my father puts something on the groceries list, I don't understand, I can assume what he means. But what if I'm wrong?   Then I have to explain it afterwards, which can cost energy and time because I might have to analyse my whole thought and then explain it all to him, my brain just can't always load this to speech effortlessly in one go...  So, now I text him asking for explanation first, before doing groceries. But he often does not see it until late, it is really annoying and also draining.  (He  goes to work during the day and writes the groceries down before or during lunch.)   I wish I could just assume like NT'S without having to worry about the result of the assuming later and/or really having problems from it later.  I will also have to deal with this kind of situations in my work later: software engineering. And also this happens in any other relationship.   Any tips?"

AspiringBiotech,6,"- No close friends   - Guilt about past behaviors   - Losing interest in special interests   - Confidence is gone   - Lifting weights (which makes me feel better) less often because I push carts all day at work  - Terrible diet because I feel my looks don’t even matter because I’ll be too awkward for women anyway, even if in shape  - No energy to fake being sociable; conversations are mostly brief and involve small talk (I also blame work for this-it drains all of my emotional reserves, making me moody half the time)  - Upset that people at work know I’m depressed...I wear my emotions on my sleeve  - Worried about the future: I‘m almost 37 years old, and still can’t afford my own place  - Feeling like nothing really matters anymore in life, in general"
joost666,7,"Every NT is all about contributing to society. Making an impact on the world. But why should you contribute to people that you don't know? Does it not make more sense to contribute to the people thay you care about and that care about you? With those people, there is a real emotional connection. Most strangers however, you don't really think about that much.  Also, why should I contribute to a system that makes life difficult for aspies? Most people don't really care about aspies.  Why should I add value to them if they make our life so much worse? They are forcing standards upon us like eye contact, phone calls, a school system that treats everyone the same, job interview standards. They also assume we have intuition for things we don't have intuition for. And lots more."
AspiringBiotech,6,"Stop getting my hopes up, damn it."
foooood4thought,13,"This is a topic that interests me, and I wonder if this has anything to do with autism.  Let me give you an example of what I am talking about.  Just now, I did a Google search about whether metal soldering would set off a smoke alarm. Less than 1 minute later, the smoke alarm tests start running in the building that I am living in. So it seems like my brain remembered what time they run smoke alarm tests in this building, and it then decided to research something else to do with smoke alarms.  Another example. I used to work a day job, and every day, I would get home, boot into my laptop, and by the time the laptop booted up, the time was precisely 17:17. It seems like my brain was precisely remembering how long it takes to walk home, and even how long precisely it takes for the laptop to start up.  Another example. I used to live with my mother. I did this thing, where I got up from chair, and suddenly started standing near the trash can in my room. Barely a few minutes later, my mother comes to my room to empty the trash bin. I must have heard her footsteps in the house, and then my brain must have remembered that this is one of the few reasons that she comes to the room. And thus, I decided myself to stand by the bin, even though it was her that comes to empty the bin, not me.  Another example. When I was a teenager, I used to visit this kooky conspiracy theory website, where it has topics written all at the top of the page, and one of the topics was ""Project Artichoke"". One evening, I was in my bedroom, and decided to click on this particular topic. Shortly after, it was dinner time, and we were having artichoke for starters. So, it seems like my brain realised that artichoke is also the name of a food, and perhaps guessed that that might be a particular type of food that we might be eating. Either that, or I had been in the kitchen earlier, and perhaps seen at a distance, that there was a bag that said ""artichoke"" on it.  So it seems like my brain does this thing, where it tries to create a pattern. Smoke alarm and smoke alarm. 17:17 and 17:17. Bin bags and bin bags. Artichoke and artichoke.  Does anyone else do this? Is this some type of autistic ""mimicking"" or ""copying"" behaviour?"

Competitive_Bid7071,16,Ever since I had my first day on the 18th of may I’ve felt good about myself and increased my optimism. It feels like I’m actually doing something that will contribute to society and actually help someone. Plus it helps with things like weight and getting exercise as it often involves physical work plus it get to take nice breaks and get free food! I thank my mother and that program I’m apart of for getting me this far.
foooood4thought,13,"I know that psychiatrists don't diagnose autism based on a brain scan, but could you?  For example, I keep seeing this image on Quora:  [https://i.imgur.com/RHZjJfv.png](https://i.imgur.com/RHZjJfv.png)  Does anyone know what this image is showing? Neurons? Synapses? I know nothing about the brain.  If I were to get an MRI or SPECT scan or something like this, is there something in the scan that I could look at, to detect whether I have an autistic brain.  Or isn't there someone like Amen Clinics or somewhere, that will actually diagnose a condition based on a brain scan?  Or if I were to just look at a print-out of my own brain scan, is there something that I could spot, to see the autism?  I say this, because there are just too many overlaps, with too many conditions, and I feel that the way psychiatrists diagnose some of these conditions is quite unscientific, especially autism."
SpektrumKid,2,"And I don't know how to even make something like that, but a verification method could just be during sign up, and instead of 'I'm not a robot' the test should be one neurotypicals would fail. Like a simple statement with a yes, no option: 'Is this an ironic statement?'  I'm rambling. But I would like to see other autistics reviews of businesses. Like how annoying is their phone hold music, how many times do they call you or try to sell you something? Is their offices super bright and loud, or is there an AC going at full volume?  Stuff like that?"

SpektrumKid,2,"Just leaving it in your throat. Until next time, and that builds upon that. And so on, until it becomes more difficult to speak, and you wind up having weird sore throats without any illness. And you realize you are avoiding certain movements because your body won't bend that way anymore (because it now hurts in weird places)."
poke000,29,"I'm told I'm supposed to appreciate other cultures, but I don't particularly even appreciate my own. A lot of cultural things seem weird to me.  If someone does something for cultural reasons, it usually means they're not doing it for logical reasons.  For example, having a wedding and spending thousands of dollars on that one day, as well as thousands of dollars on a diamond ring, is not rational. It's cultural.  On the other hand, going to the doctor if you get an injury is rational, and you wouldn't go for cultural reasons."
poke000,29,"I really want to buy some more home workout equipment, but I am put off by all the prop 65 warnings and the heavy uses of plastics like PVC/vinyl.  I've read articles hyping up the danger, and the chemical smells these things tend to have-- it seems to enforce what those articles are saying.  Plus they usually have the prop 65 warnings as well.  However, as I get better at research, I've learned that a lot of these articles are based on unreliable studies or information that has been misinterpreted.  And the prop 65 warning is apparently almost meaningless in most people's opinion.  So now I question if there is enough science to support the idea that it would be dangerous to have these materials in your home.  I think I've spent too much time being paranoid for nothing.    Any scientifically minded people here who can put things in perspective for me?"
SpektrumKid,2,"I meant to say 'youtuber'  :)  he's very insightful for someone so young.

AspiringBiotech,6,Noise pollution is real. I’m tired of all of the background noise. It’s so damn rude.
Competitive_Bid7071,16,I mean I’ve always had this sort of problem for some seemingly unknown reason. Now I don’t consider myself a full on materialist but it’s still upsetting to see seemingly pretty or nice looking items someone owns get destroyed or ruined by something else like a storm or some other natural disaster in a film or show. In fact it still bugs me. Did you ever have a similar issue?

Competitive_Bid7071,16,So a while back I found out I’m getting a job but I finally today have learned when I’ll start working. It turns out it will be next Tuesday although I’m kinda nervous about it. What’s some advice you can give me?
SpektrumKid,2,"I wonder if anyone else feels this way. My friend is vaccinated and I asked him how he felt about not having to wear masks. He’s not gonna wear one anymore, which made me realize that now I have to look at his face and all that work of interpreting all that information that comes with it.   I started liking hanging out because the lack of facial information just made it so much easier.   But now I actually dread whether or not I’ll be able to handle it.   What if I cant?"
poke000,29,"I usually consider myself gay because I am attracted to men (certain men with somewhat particular features).  I went through a very short Grindr phase. It was surprisingly easy to find guys who were willing AND were my type (apparently I'm good-looking and I have abs).  But when I looked at my life I don't think it was making me happy.  Neither did being in a monogamous relationship.  A few years ago I decided I never want to have sex or have a relationship.  I mean literally never. No more.  I am not repulsed by sex, but I just feel I can go without it.  Life is simpler without it.  I think it's a matter of the pros outweighing the cons for me.  Sex is always going to carry some amount of risk, it's messy (to varying degrees), and it means having to deal with another person which can always be annoying to me, in any context.  What I'm giving up is...honestly not that much.  Sure it feels good but it doesn't last long.  Stretching feels good too and it comes with much fewer negatives.  Lots of things feel good without all the potential trouble that comes with being sexually active.  I also like this sense of power that I feel when I have people interested in me but not letting it lead to anything.  I'm kind of a tease.  I post a picture of my face and body on hookup apps, people DM me and express interest, and I say, ""Nah I'm good.  Thanks though!"""

Competitive_Bid7071,16,I mean I personally go to come party’s/gatherings around certain holidays or family events as I’m kinda forced to. But other then that I have enjoyed most of them as they seem like just giant parties. Although there are some other “festivals” that are not themed around family that I’ve also not minded participating in.

joost666,7,"Everyday I wake up, I'm warm under the bedsheets, but my body just hates going out of them, because the temperature in the room is way more cold.   Some solution which helps a bit is putting on music and then changing clothes, that way my brain focuses more on the music than on the cold, but I still feel it. Another is changing clothes under the bedsheets, but that's annoying.   I also experience this sensitivity to cold with swimming pools, I will never swim in my life again, because of the initial feeling when going in.   Also, I procrastinate with going out of the shower because that's also really cold.   Does anybody else have such sensitivity with cold?  How do you deal with it?"

joost666,7,"Sometimes I have the same amount of emotion for a friend that I imagine is suffering as someone else that I don't know.   I then ignore the feelings towards the unknown person because it should not be the same amount. In my mind I should not care at all if I don't really have a connection with them, but still I do.   Feelings are never objective and never logical. But how do you make decisions then? Which feelings are ""true"" and which are not?   Example: Unknown man is collapsed in the street and I feel the need to help them. Thoughts: why should I help? Do I really care? I feel the need to help, but I have no history with him, like with friends, no relationship. I never did anything with them. Is he then not just some molecules that are functioning incorrectly compared to the friends that I do have history with?   If not: how can it be that I care the same for someone that I don't know as much as people that I do know. I don't want that because it feels like the people that I do know don't mean much to me.   I wish I could lower the amount of feelings for people to make it match with how much I know them. Or increase the amount of feelings for people I do care about, so that it is higher than for those that I don't know. But I can't.   What do you think about this?"

My mother was confused as the staff seemed to appreciate how smart I was and one of the manager liked how smart I was. That is until I told one of them I had autism. Then I didn’t get the job. This led my mother to think the manger was a bigot to autistic people and I continue to have this issue. Do you ever experience this?"

Competitive_Bid7071,16,I mean just today one of my teachers in my special needs room got upset when I was walking back from the nurse because I said “Hi” to a student I know as a compliment. She then had me talk with her about how “bad” me saying hi to someone was during class time (despite other students and staff doing it a lot) and seemed to try and gas light/guilt trip me saying I “cannot” be trusted to go to other parts of the school by myself and would need someone to accompany me. I then bluntly accused her of being a bigot and using bigoted dog whistles against me as an autistic person which she denied. I honestly don’t like when adults do this because I feel subhuman and it makes my anxiety go up. Do you feel a similar way or had a similar situation?
Competitive_Bid7071,16,"I personally have this issue a lot, I often study things deeply in order to understand a lot of what’s in my world and to peruse my special interests. At various points though I sometimes get so invested in everything that I don’t bother to think about if me doing something or joining a group and or club is actually a good idea as for all I know they may take advantage of me or something bad could happen to be because I didn’t take lots of things into consideration. Have you ever been in a similar situation?"
Competitive_Bid7071,16,I was recently talking to my mother over the weekend and she told me a program I’m apart of to help autistic people find good jobs may have actually found me a position at my local movie theater. I was honestly shocked and very happy as I can finally have an actual job and not be rejected by the business manager just because of my disability. I’m honestly very happy and glade I can finally do something else in my life.
AspiringBiotech,6,"A woman at work a month ago or so overheard me talking about Viva Chicken and said „ohhh, I love that place“. While talking to another coworker, he suggested maybe going out with her. I waited and waited, building up the courage to say (when the topic came up again), „I like that place too! Maybe I can buy you some soon“. Her response: „that’s ok...but thank you“. She was very polite. Still, I don’t understand the rejection. She had even told me earlier today that she was bored and wished she had more exciting things to do. Did I word things awkwardly? Did she even understand that I was trying to ask her out?  I mean f@ck. I don’t care if we are only friends. I’m just trying to make some connections. It’s so hard. Maybe I just misread everything and she never liked me like I thought she did in the first place."

poke000,29,"I lie sometimes, and I used to assume other's lie at about the same rate I did.  I thought people are generally honest unless they have a clear and defined reason to be dishonest.  As I've gotten older, I've realized people seem to lie more often than I thought, and there isn't always a good reason for it.  I can deal with that though-- just a matter of adjusting my expectations.  **The difficult part is that people like that will always assume others lie just as much as they do.**  They project their own flaws onto you.  There have been so many times people haven't believed me when I was telling the truth.  And in these cases, they're wrong, you know they're wrong, but there often isn't a good way to prove it.  Anyone else experience this?"
AspiringBiotech,6,"- don’t waste years of your life assuming people dislike you or are out to get you...and don’t waste any energy disliking others; it’s not true that people dislike you anyway, for the most part (unless you’ve royally offended them lol)...  - let all minor misunderstandings go...that’s what adults do...it doesn’t mean you were wrong ...it means you’re mature and tactful  - you don’t have to prove your intelligence to anyone (executive functioning issues sometimes make many of us a bit forgetful/slow)...just relax and tell people about your interests and it will be apparent...also, keep written notes on hand and review them in private before having a conversation on a certain topic at work or in school, if need be   - be fun and funny...but don’t try too hard...just make sure you aren’t coming off as depressed and anxious too often or it will drive friends away...people need positivity in their lives now more than ever"
Competitive_Bid7071,16,"I mean I absolutely love cheese burgers and French fries when there available and also really like stuffed crust pizza. I don’t know why there’s just something about the taste and texture which makes me crave it constantly and feel extremely satisfied, and it’s only made stronger when I have ice cream afterwards. Do you have a similar experience?  Also do you like Juicy foods to because I love steak for that reason."
Competitive_Bid7071,16,"While I’m in no way a “mean” person to random people or close people I talk to often I find it annoying whenever I give people constructive criticism or bluntly criticize things people say to me or believe in they accuse me of “putting them down” despite me not clearly doing that. It’s like they have some sort of victim complex and cannot accept criticism from people and shouldn’t change things that are clearly flawed. It’s just odd to me how lots of them don’t seem rationalistic and rather rely on emotions to guide them, and while I have nothing against emotions or people feeling something is wrong just blindly following emotions is never good. What people should do in my opinion is have good ethics based on factual data and what they feel is good as while you can be rational you can have good ethics."

AspiringBiotech,6,"I’m not sure if the friend was ever really a friend, or just an aquaintance. I walked into a coffee shop one day and the long-haired Layne Staley look-alike behind the counter had a mischievous grin on his face but kind eyes. I ordered my coffee and then sat down at the coffee bar with a book in my hand. After a few minutes of reading, I heard him telling jokes to coworkers and I laughed and commented, which prompted him to joke around with me, and I with him. Over the course of a year and a half, we shared personal stories, commiserated over political issues, discussed our hobbies and interests, etc. We gave each other book recommendations. He gave me free drinks at times. I gave him old books. I felt I could tell him anything. He always had good advice to give. Yet the guy is notorious for ignoring text messages and doesn’t use social media, and he recently left the coffee shop to work as a web designer. I fear I’ll never hear from him or see him again. I wasn’t the best „friend“ I could have been. I was depressed and anxious late last year and early into this year. I was caught up in my own problems. I wasn’t the best listener. Still, I felt a very strong interpersonal connection with him, which is extremely rare for me. I thought the feeling was mutual. Perhaps it was until I sabotaged things."

poke000,29,"I've told my boss. Most people I haven't told, though I prefer everyone did know, so they would know I'm not an asshole.  Do you think people misinterpret you less often when they know you're on the spectrum? Have there been times you have alienated your coworkers? Did you recover from it?"
Competitive_Bid7071,16,Personally as a Minnesotan I probably would say in my home state considering I do feel content and comfortable living in it. Although another state I wouldn’t mind at all is Vermont or Delaware considering they have huge historical significance and are home to some of the politicians I really like such as Bernie Sanders. Plus the scenic views are quite nice and peaceful.
poke000,29,"Growing up with ASD has been extremely difficult. I typically get along great with people now, but it wasn't always this way. I've managed to alienate and upset friends, family, and even people at work-- whenever they didn't understand my neurodivergent tendencies. I'm especially worried about having alienated coworkers as it could affect my career.  I think I actually have complex PTSD from all the many many uncomfortable altercations I've had with people-- usually people being very rude because they thought I was being rude. I have flashbacks every day and sometimes it's hard to sleep.  How can I deal with this? I have anger towards myself and towards all the ignorant people who treated me like I was trying to antagonize them."
AspiringBiotech,6,"3-5 days, for me. I just want to know what’s going on quickly. Is that so much to ask?"
poke000,29,"**I have a fear that being on the spectrum will eventually lead to me losing my job.**  I actually tell all my managers I'm on the spectrum just so they have that disclaimer.  I think I come off as, well... off.  It's hard for me to talk and think at the same time so I rarely come off as intelligent in the way I speak.    It's like even when I learn social skills, I still don't have the social *instinct* that most people have.  The potential for misunderstandings is enormous.    \---**Example---**  *Two years ago, when I first started, I think I convinced all my cubical mates I was angry when I really was not.  When we had our monthly busy days, I would try to show that I took my job seriously by moving really fast.  Walking quickly over to the coffee bar, quickly opening and shutting doors, and even talking faster than normal.  It hindsight I must have been so annoying to my neighbors.  My team.*    *But in my head I just thought it was normal office noises and the commotion that is expected during busy times.  It wasn't until I calmed down and paid attention that nobody else was really doing that. I didn't hear any slamming cupboards, or too-fast footsteps from anyone else-- it was just me.  I think I was doing this because of my years working in fast food-- where you had to be fast to be valuable.*  *Nobody said anything, but now that I am more self aware, I think this would have been interpreted as an angry disgruntled worker with a bad attitude stomping around.  Did I have an attitude? No, not internally.  I think it was pretty innocent.  But unfortunately, things don't always translate the same way when expressed to others.  I find this hard to explain to NTs-- when I've tried, they seemed to think I was making excuses for just being an a\*\*h\*\*\*.*  **I'm finding it difficult to move past all the times I've made a fool of myself, and managed to alienate my team.  How can I let go and move forward?**"

Competitive_Bid7071,16,I recently have gotten a shaving kit and absolutely love it!

Competitive_Bid7071,16,"My mother constantly does this and it’s the most annoying thing I have to deal with!

Also lots of the people talking sound incredibly stupid or misinformed especially when the video talks of religion or politics. Does this ever bother you at all."
Competitive_Bid7071,16,I’m personally largely into Greco-Roman history along with lots of cultures and histories of lots of norther Europeans such as the Gauls and Britons. I personally find these cultures quite interesting and find it interesting how these religious and cultural beliefs have both persisted and been revived by various people in the 21st century so much so I’ve considered joining a Hellenic or Celtic group just to talk about these things in public despite not practicing the religion. What’s your favorite period in history you love to study?

poke000,29,"I can usually pick up when I've made a social blunder based on subtle cues from people.  I barely understand these cues, but I seem to be able to pick them up regardless.    From there I can analyze the situation (sometimes in a harmful, obsessive way) to find out what I did specifically that people reacted strangely to.    I think this process has helped me learn a lot of social skills, but I am still not good with social aspects of life.  It's like I have a lot of the skills, but I didn't have the instinct.  I had to learn the skills.  And even now, I don't always know when or how to apply them consistently.  I almost think that social instinct wins out in the end over social skills.  Because people can be great socially without having pursued any learning or trying to polish their skills.  They didn't need to."
poke000,29,"I am not sure if this is a typical trait of people with ASD, but based on my observations, I am much more logically minded than most people.

UPDATE: Getting a variety of responses here with no clear consensus, other than that we care about different things. Thanks for the comments everyone."
SpektrumKid,2,"I think it may have to do with my brains obsession with repetition, that makes it hard to actually ever feel bored. I can find enjoyment in finding repeating patterns in everything, and become fixated on it for hours at a time. Who has time to be bored?  Anyone else?  EDIT: I guess I should have specified, *'...when left to your own devices.'*"
SpektrumKid,2,"By the time it takes me to have my feelings, detect my feelings, feel my feelings, interpret and recognize my feelings, process my feelings and ultimately express my feelings … people have moved on."
AspiringBiotech,6,"For example, someone posted in a group I’m in „why don’t we ask why people feared witches instead of those who burned them alive?“, and, to deal with such a sad subject emotionally, my mind immediately thought „I fear them both“ and I had the urge to post it. But I didn’t. Because I know people would go crazy on me. I’d be called a misogynist or worse. Yet my joke would have been merely stating that some women are crazy too (not that any were actually evil witches or deserved to be harmed...the point would have been an exaggerated, unrealistic comparison, a quite common comedic trope). It’s like nuance is simply beyond people today.  I realize that society has changed for the better in many ways; yet I’m a 90s/early 20s child. We grew up in an era when pushing the envelope was praised and even rewarded. We watched Jerry Springer and South Park religiously. We mimicked the behavior of famous „bad boy/bad girl“ celebrities. We laughed at Comedy Central Roasts. Many of us are still learning how to be more sensitive...which is good...but can’t we at least occasionally make light of tragedy, especially if it’s used as a coping mechanism?"

poke000,29,"The psychologist who diagnosed me in the 90's was not very experienced, and missed my OCD.  I very clearly have OCD and it's been on ongoing struggle in my life.  Obsessions about germs, frequent hand washing, compulsively checking things, etc. are all things I do that can be attributed to OCD.  It's textbook.  However, I do have other symptoms that don't fit with OCD and may have been the basis for my Asperger's diagnosis.  I guess the most simplistic description is social awkwardness.  I've learned a lot of social skills, but it's like I had no social *instinct*.    It's like I would process things in a way that seemed logical but failed to account for things like context.  For example, when I was around 12, I noticed that my brother would playfully ""throw shade"" at one of our mutual friends, and noticed that oddly seemed to make their bond stronger. So out of the blue I called the friend stupid (in front of his family no less), hoping he would realize I was just being playful.  It was met with a very long and very awkward silence.  Reading people was always difficult.  I can tell if someone reacts strangely, but I don't always know how to interpret it (of course, it's gotten much better over the years).  Thoughts?"

SpektrumKid,2,I have the Sony headphones and they have been a life saver. But I just realized I made a playlist of rain sounds one time while I was trying to find the perfect one. Somehow that playlist ended up on my Apple Watch and just now I was about to have a panic attack or meltdown over something and I realized I could start rain sounds almost instantaneously.    It’s oh so soothing.   Maybe this is a good thing to have handy. I guess you could substitute soothing sounds if other things soothes you more in stressful situations.   I think it’s gonna be quite handy now that I know this.
SpektrumKid,2,"I basically loved HealthTap. I was able to see a doctor over video any time, and from the comfort of my home. When I go to an actual doctor is just SO much anxiety to overcome, and I can never remember what happened or what the doctor said because I'm so uncomfortable with new people, and the surroundings and whatever stress accumulated on the trip there.  To be honest, getting kicked off healthTap is kind of a bummer, but maybe it's time I get a new 21st century ready doc.  Ideally it'd be the same doctor every time, that I could also OPTIONALLY see in real life, if absolutely necessary.   Is there such a service? (I'm in New York if that matters.)"
SpektrumKid,2,Today's shower thought.
SpektrumKid,2,"If you know what line in what movie I'm referring to. It's never OK for a neurotypical actor to 'go full r#' because it very easily can come off offensive.  ~~But us who are mentally handicapped.~~..Those of us who are challenged by our autism (I really just mean me, and whomever else can relate to this post), maybe should allow ~~ourselves~~ myself to let go of all the masking once in a while, and let ~~ourselves~~ myself fully express the extent of ~~our~~ my autism?  It certainly makes me feel free if I can flap around and make random sounds without fearing anyone judging me for it. Getting rid of that fear is ... very difficult.  So I guess that's why I'm posting this post. Is it ok for us, to go full....?"
SpektrumKid,2,"Like if I have a few options on what to do in a situation, I can't see beyond the first choice. I can't know how I feel once the first choice is executed, so I can't know what my second choice will be.  Like taking a trip, starts by deciding where to go... but I can't know WHEN until I've decided where. And sometimes I can't decide where, until I've decided when, putting me in a catch 22.  This goes for everything. If I have to do two things in one day, I can't decide on doing the one thing before the other or vice versa. Sometimes I just have to postpone one by laying in bed until I compulsively fly out of bed, and rush to the post office to pick up my package. Prescription drugs will have to wait til tomorrow then!  Does anyone else feel this way?  It reminds me of the Matrix Reloaded scene, where the oracle says something like 'you've already made the choice, now you have to understand it'. Not sure if that relates, but I feel like I'm not really in control of myself sometimes, and it's the id making the choices and I just spring into life at the very last moment to carry them out."

AspiringBiotech,6,"Remember when a „household name“ was actually a pretty much universal household name? Now, I have no clue who all of these people are. Fans talk about how certain rappers and actors are the „GOAT“, but largely only those in their relatively small fanbase know about them. There no longer seems to be a shared cultural taste in society. This isn’t all bad but it seems to me to be a sign of the times...we as a country aren’t getting together to enjoy the same music and movies. I used to feel that it was something that brought unity via shared experiences, as a kid."
urbanracer34,0,"I work for a big company on a yearly contract basis. Every year it requires renewal. These were the conditions I was hired on.

I was checking my work email this morning and I got a weird message. It was from an automated system to update my access to one of the systems we use. I felt the timing was weird. I didn't request this.   I called up my manager and politely asked for an explanation.   She told me that my work contract has been extended for another year, and that they were just doing the necessary paperwork.   She submitted the request for extension, and it went through her boss, her bosses boss, HR and the VP of the section of the company I'm in. All parties approved it.

SpektrumKid,2,"#   I just wanted to share that I've somewhat managed to automate my food intake. Since the pandemic happened and pretty much ALL my routines were broken, I've been on a pendulum back and forth between severe constipation or severe diarrhea, simply because I couldn't manage to eat or drink water regularly without the structure of my routines.  The formula is:  An Apple Watch where I can keep a few complications on my watch face that keeps me informed of:  Hydration levels (I use a smart water bottle called Hidrate)  Nutrition levels  Weight (Smart bathroom scale)  and steps counter.  I'm using an app called Lifesum that taps into the HealthKit framework on the Apple Watch, and there's another app called HealthGlance where you can pick which health categories you wanna keep tabs on. Mine are set to Fiber and Carbs.  and then the actual meals are from Daily Harvest and Sweetgreen which both are already in the Lifesum database, so it's pretty easy to log.  Seems to be working. Now I just have to find the right balance of food, but I'm definitely more regular than I've been in ages."

AspiringBiotech,6,I’ve got to fix this.
AspiringBiotech,6,A.) No one cares   B.) It’s extremely unprofessional   C.) It takes away time from discussing actual issues
joost666,7,"*Empathy  Most other people I hear have this idea of ""everybody matters"". But I just can't feel the same.   I care about people that I know.  Furthermore, I care  if I see people suffering, in reality or in stories(movies, series, books and more). But only if I have seen a lot of the person they are, background stories or if I have had a similar experience. Otherwise I don't.   Example: With the virus, I don't really want to help the patients because lack of knowing who they are, lack of background stories or lack of having a similar experience. I don't care if they suffer or even die.  However, if they would show me a documentary about getting to know a nice person, their life story and then let them die of the virus, I have a high chance that I feel for that person.   So, character development and character exploration does matter to me. Similar experience also can help. I don't just care about anyone. Like most people say that they do.   Does anybody also feel for others this way?"

joost666,7,"Just curious.   How do you think an Aspie society would differ from our current society?  I would think we would be more advanced in technology.   NT's would have it difficult instead of us. We would say things like: ""why does that matter"" when they try smalltalking or ""No, I'm not looking you in your eyes, that's weird, I can't focus that way"" :p.   We would have noise canceling headphones everywhere and surpressors on noise causing vehicles. Maybe also walls that block sound. Maybe also a lot of people wearing sunglasses.    A lot of people would work from home, maybe?  There would also be a democracy with lots of debates, I think.  There might be less war? Because we tend to reason more.   Social skills wouldn't matter that much. A job interview would come down to skill only.  Maybe more people could turn their special interest into a job."

joost666,7,"Why do NT students always procrastinate when working in teams?   I have been in projects where they always shove all the work to the end, to discover that it is too difficult to finish on time. But I wanted a sufficient grade, so I worked on the project at night because of this, to still meet the requirements of the project. This has made college way less fun. Actually not fun anymore. There was constant stress of working just before the deadline and also the tiredness. It has become more about surviving than about having fun in learning.   We did get  grades as a group  in projects and not individual. It would be better and more fair to grade individually though.  Now my trust is very low when doing projects. I want to work as soon as possible. I'm also trying to guide teammates by saying thing like: ""Could you say when you are done early? Then I can hand it in. "" or ""Will you do part x before the deadline and also hand it in?"".  It is really annoying. Luckily, I don't have to work in a team anymore this year at school."
SpektrumKid,2,"I always used to be the one to reach out to connect. Now the situation is reversed. I've gotten quite comfortable not having to socialize with anyone, but the two real friends I had/have keep sending me texts to engage in conversations, and since I rarely do talk to people now, it's just so much work to even start up that process in my mind where one engages in conversation. I find it extremely taxing these days.  I can respond and then chat for a while, but I do it more out of obligation to get some peace for another week before another text comes in about something mundane.   How do I get it to stop without hurting my friends feelings?   I just wanna live in a silent retreat until I naturally reach out myself, because I can't really process having social interactions over text that doesn't have a natural end point.   Whenever a friend texts, I feel that guilt hanging over my head, that I should text him back. But then I will become engaged in conversation, and I don't want to do that right now.  What do I do?   Right now I default to just not answering because I literally don't know what to write. Should I not let the fear of loosing my friends govern how I act, if I need to really go into some deep meditation and just take care of my own needs for once?"
AspiringBiotech,6,"I’m excited to be taking graduate level Cell and Molecular Biology this semester. I just viewed the syllabus and saw that we have open book and note exams! The only thing that concerns me is that the professor stated that problem solving would be one of the main methods used for answering mid-term and final exam questions (60% of the grade). As someone who is very literal minded, big-picture focused, and who has trouble „thinking outside the box“, I hope I don’t miss out on any important minor details. My previous Biology courses mostly involved multiple choice and short answer responses. I want to be challenged, but not overwhelmed. I really hope I can get through this!"
SpektrumKid,2,"I don’t like change. This is mostly because my brain analyzes things in deep detail, but doesn’t have the refresh rate of change in reality. So I like to put things on pause and just gander and take in all the details. Change is inevitable but I have a hard time processing it all.  People change. And that change is subtle.   I have/had a friend (who may or may not have covid, he hasn’t told me yet), and he used to be this jaded but optimistic person who was like my guide to New York.  Then he moved in with his new girlfriend a few years ago, and his personality has soured over the years. Now it literally makes me feel angry and sad whenever I hang out with him. Not like it used to. He spends most of the time yelling about things he’s angry about, and it’s really hard to take in.  So now I hardly ever see him. It’s heartbreaking because he still texts me and asks to hang out, but for numerous reasons (he’s not a happy masker, he doesn’t take care of the covid threat) I just try to stay away. Mostly because to even get to him, I have to cross several truck heavy streets (and that gives me an elevated rise in blood pressure), and then hanging out with him is stressful, whereas before it was joyful.   Am I wrong in spending less time with him? Also I feel like we’ve been growing apart (that meaning, he’s gotten older and I have stayed the same). The age difference is just greater now than it was when we met.  Deep down I just want my old friend back (pre-covid days), but I fear he's changed for the worse is gonna be permanent. It hasn't been good for a few years."
AspiringBiotech,6,"Like me? Howso? The people I speak to at work and school are also mostly tired and say random things. We all laugh at the same jokes, discuss politics, complain about work, etc. I’ve even been in relationships with what others seem to consider „normal“ women and we got along well (for a few weeks...). Does my inability to constantly have something to talk about limit my dating prospects? It doesn’t seem to stop men I know from being loved and admired. Am I boring, once I tell someone about my family, school, and hobbies? Do I not pay enough attention to what others say? Do negative thoughts keep my mind too preoccupied and shut me down mentally, driving people away? Once again, it doesn’t seem to be a hindrance for any of my male friends. Perhaps I’m just bad at hiding my feelings. Yet that’s a fairly common trait, shared by many couples...Do executive functioning issues lead people to believe that I’m „special“, despite having a college degree and having taken challenging courses such as Stats, Organic Chemistry, and Genomic Stability and Disease post-undergrad? Maybe at times. In certain situations. But people who know me well view me as well-read and intelligent (which matters to the type of women I’d like to attract).  I don’t consider other people on the spectrum to be „like me“ at all, in many cases. I understand all but the most subtle social cues (at least now I do). I’m capable (when I’m not feeling stressed or depressed) of holding fairly long conversations with others, discussing their interests and desires and knowing just what to say or do to brighten their day (well, in my opinion...). I maintain (non-awkward) eye-contact, which women often reciprocate and which usually makes them smile. Sure, many of them are simply being kind, but we sometimes even flirt on rare occasions."
AspiringBiotech,6,"My dad and I have been watching Dexter together, and he told me he relates to the main character having to pretend to be normal (not the serial killer mindset part though lol) and having to watch others to know what to say and do in social situations. He and I both feel we‘ve pushed people away unintentionally in the past and wish we could relive our teenage and young adult years. We are both highly sensitive to criticism, highly sensitive to certain sounds and noises, impatient, highly opinionated, hyper-focused on a small set of specific subjects, pedantic when it comes to anything language related, and don’t always pick up on certain social cues.  I think we both have Aspergers (I still use the term out of convenience; it’s much less vague than „on the spectrum“ or „high functioning autism“), though we‘ve both always maintained regular eye contact with people (as far as I can remember) and had close friends as kids. We are both fairly talkative. I can be awkward at times but I realize when I’m doing so, for the most part. That’s what makes it so frustrating. I feel I’m observing some mentally aloof person from afar, critiquing his every action, but unable to act quickly enough to help him. I hope my father doesn’t feel that way as well. He has some childhood trauma issues to cope with in addition to whatever he is dealing with psychologically. Though we share many symptoms, we are both very different people. My father has always been good at impulse control and putting other people first. He has also never had difficulty understanding and explaining relatively complex, multi-part information. It took me much longer to learn to control my temper, to learn how to treat people well, to understand other worldviews, to understand social context, to patiently read a book, to learn basic Math, etc. On the other hand, I notice my father has trouble understanding when people are upset with him unless it’s made quite obvious and that he used to have trouble admitting when he was wrong."
joost666,7,"I don't want to work more than 28 hours per week when I finish college. Because 7*8 hours of productivity a day = 56 hours a week. To make it fair I would want a one-to-one relation between work and free time so 56 hours/2 = 28 hours. This way for every hour I work, I get one hour of freedom  But I don't see many vacancies in IT that allow 28 hours or less. It seems they all want 40, 36 or sometimes 32 hours. Does anybody know why this is the case? Why are they so obsessed with fulltime work? As if we live to work instead of work to live?   I see work as something that can be fun, but I wouldn't do it if I didn't have to. Not for a boss/company I mean. And freelance is an option but it would be to stressful for me though.   I want to do my own goals in life as well, besides working. For example I'm trying to compose a piano piece currently, just for fun. But if it becomes good, I will try and release it. But another month after that I could do something totally different. That is what to me is freedom.   This is how I want to live my life instead of being stuck in a full-time job as a slave for the company. A job to me is just a tradeoff: I do the work, I get paid. But when I don't work, I do what I want."
AspiringBiotech,6,"If you’re feeling overwhelmed, depressed, or anxious and have been limiting interactions with others and feel that socially withdrawing is negatively affecting your personal relationships, school, your work life, etc...stop. Just stop. Don’t feel guilty for being human. It will only make you feel more overwhelmed, depressed, or anxious. Allow yourself to put all non-essential activities on hold for as long as it takes to heal. True friends will understand and give you time."

SpektrumKid,2,"I feel like it happens all the time. I take too long to cross the street, they aim at me, speed up to try to intimidate me, and swerve at the last second.  Today I was moving a barrier back into place on this section in Brooklyn they call #openstreets, which means they are just for pedestrians and everyone else but cars. But this driver got very upset apparently, so he got out to move the barrier back so he could get in with his car.   As I stood on the street 20 feet away and just watched him do this, as he got into his car he deliberately aimed for me and sped up, and swerved at the last second to park in front of the restaurant he was gonna pick up his food at.  Why do people do that kind of thing? It's deeply upsetting. I'm gonna be frazzled all day, feeling like someone just tried to kill me for no apparent reason.  Does this happen to anyone else? Maybe it's my hat that's too colorful and makes me look like a clown? I'm otherwise wearing pretty muted tones, but maybe I stick out too much? Or are people just really aggressive now for some reason?"

MenuTime5231,32,"I've been looking deeper into depression and I'm at the point where it would be in my best interest to get medicated.   I need help not greiving that theres something ""wrong"" with me that I'm not strong enough or unwilling enough to do on my own.   There's feelings that it got my dad and that it got me too and untreated depression would make a lot of sense as to why my life is how it is. I don't want to feel like I'm thriving once every 3 months I want to thrive all the time. I don't want that dark shadow always standing in the corner of the room.  I could say that this is just situational depression and if I hadn't lost my loved one that I'd be happy right now but it's just too much evidence that I'd just be waiting on the other shoe to drop.b  If I take them and it does everything I expect it to do then I have to reconcile that all this time I've spent prior was hurting myself under the guise that I could help myself  I'm also scared anti depressents will make me more depressed."
Elusive-Yoda,25,"I'v been suffering from crippling depression and anxiety since my late teens, it went unchecked for well over a decade.   last year in my early 30s i started antidepressant and i'm slowly crawling out of the hole i was living in, but its really hard because looking back, my life is like a steamy crater after a meteorite strike, there is nothing left.  No job, no money, no relationships other then the couple friends i still have left from high school.  i have nothing, its like i was in a coma for the past decade.  i have so much regrets now, its dragging me down."
FaithInStrangers94,33,"I was born without consent into an existence characterised by meaningless pain and suffering of some form. I was born into a slow death and a steady decline and will eventually lose it all. I was born as a biochemical flesh puppet under the illusion that I am the master of my fate. I was born to creep across the surface of this speck of dust adrift within an indifferent and unfathomable abyss that doesn’t know we exist and doesn’t care for our sense of right and wrong. So were you.   It just doesn’t add up; the pleasure doesn’t justify the pain and the upsides are outweighed by the downsides.   And yet I’m expected to bear it all with a smile labelled as mentally ill if I don’t, and condemned if I decide I would rather leap off this hamster wheel. Now of course if everyone were constantly brooding on grim reality the morale within society would plummet and it would soon collapse, but to have people question your mental health for questioning existence is questionable itself - have they never pondered their existence before? Have they been too busy dancing across the stage to notice the strings and the invisible hand that’s jostling them? Don’t they realise what a complete hideous farce this is?  Obviously depression involves a measurable chemical imbalance which can be inherited and triggered by major events, but I feel like the source of my depression is more existential in nature. However what I’m not certain about is whether my view is exacerbating depression or whether my bleak outlook is stemming from depression.   I try to forget about the bigger picture and live for the moment; I can still experience some laughter and happiness  - those are the moments that keep me trudging through the trenches - but they’ve been tainted by the above realisations. I don’t laugh as loud or as long as I did in my youth before reality came to crash the party.  In saying that dark humour and irony are the best coping mechanisms I have at my disposal.   Religion, escapism and the reliance on mental health services remind me that it’s not uncommon to feel this way. Religion gives artificial purpose and meaning to our suffering; escapism allows us to forget for a while, and mental health intervention tries to uplift us by addressing our brain chemistry and thoughts - fortunately these work as antidotes for many people, not all though.   I wouldn’t ever talk anyone into ending themselves, but I do sense that the reason more haven’t stepped off the mortal coil voluntarily is because they’re afraid of the pain, of what comes next and of how it will impact their legacy and the ones they leave behind.  Anyway the question I have is…  Where does one draw the line between depression and a recognition of the harsh realities of existence?"
PotentialAgile951,4,I'm autistic though and I've started cutting my self. Is that a symptom of depression. And I know this is but I've also started thinking about ending it.
Nicenastybuttercup,19,:(
carter_pride,46,I used to think I was special and that I was meant got great things.  Only thing worse than depression is having an entitled mindset.  I’m over it now.  What a f—— up I turned out to be.  Anyway.  One day at a time now.  I don’t want to know what’s ahead anymore.  Depression sucks.  It’s like a fog.  You can’t see ahead anymore.
carter_pride,46,I feel like crying.  I don’t know why.  I feel like such a failure in life.  I wish I could just disappear.  Everything I do feels pointless sometimes.  Why keep fighting and trying so hard?
carter_pride,46,… until my knuckles are bleeding.  That’s what’s ahead.  That’s the life ahead of me.  I regret nothing.    F—- depression… mental illness… OCD… schizotypal disorder… delusion disorder… dissociation… and whatever else I might have…  I just want to keep fighting until I bleed to death.
carter_pride,46,"I feel I’ve worked very hard in my daily grind, but I have not made any significant changes in the “big picture”.  I talk a lot, but I do nothing and I accomplish nothing.  I just talk about my dreams.  All I do is work in “the factory” and earn my paycheck, and then go home and vegetate and I don’t want to move or change anything.  I have spent decades talking about my dreams and then done literally nothing and accomplished absolutely nothing.  What is wrong with me?  I just want to hide under the covers until I am dead.  This is not normal."
carter_pride,46,I wanted a lot more than I accomplished.  Don’t get me wrong. I am grateful for whatever I have.  Still… one can’t help wondering where things went so wrong versus what I had originally dreamed of achieving.  Series of disappointments.
Living_Pin_2781,35,I'm genuinely just curious. Do you guys have your own definitions for it and your own system to cope with them?
littledaisy_07,8,I lowkey expected it but it really hurts. I’m supposed to study for my exams next week but I truly lack of motivation/will/strength and idk how it’ll go. It feels like the only energy I have is carrying on with my compulsions
NameIntrepid,9,My head’s full of brain fog and I’m completely detached from myself. My ruminating has become this constant thing and I can’t recognize the difference between that and a normal thought. I just wish this could end :(.
littledaisy_07,8,I’m sick of these posts. I try to convince myself nothing bad will happen if I don’t repost the sound/video/picture/... but it’s so scary. I always feel like terrible things will happen if I don’t follow the instructions and don’t repost the thing 😞 anyone else has this?
turquoiseturtle01,5,Years ago I got a gummy bear charm chain bracelet and zipper bracelet from Claire’s. They were some of the favorite bracelets I wore in middle school. I had them saved for awhile. In 2019 I was in a hurry decluttering a lot of jewelry in preparation of reorganizing my room and getting a new bed. Most of the bracelets and other jewelry I gave away were in ziplock bags donated to a thrift store. My mom made me hurry with decluttering that I really didn’t have a chance to thoroughly go through what to keep and give away since there was a rush to get the new bed. I thought I might’ve saved those specific bracelets in a jewelry box or drawer in my room. I feel like I saw them recently with some of the jewelry I kept. A few days ago I was looking through my bracelets to find the gummy bear and zipper bracelets but they weren’t there. I looked everywhere in my room and couldn’t find them. I kept getting obsessive thoughts and images in my mind of what those bracelets looked like and I really regret giving them away. I’ll never see those bracelets and other jewelry I gave away again because of that rush I was in. I really wish I had a second chance to have those things back. I still can’t stop thinking about them. I really miss wearing those bracelets and it’s making feel some grief like apart of me is missing. How can I get those things back? Do I deserve a another chance since it was one of the things that made me happy? Do I deserve another chance too so I don’t get obsessive thoughts about them again? Would prayer work for those things missing to return or should I check the thrift store to see if an employee can check in the back to look for them?
Living_Pin_2781,35,"Let me clarify: By that question, I mean, when an intrusive thoughts come up, is there any immediate reaction (whether mental or physical) that you show/do in order to somehow deflect or cope with the sudden appearance of your intrusive thought?  For example, in my case, whenever I suddenly get an intrusive thought, I would immediately utter a counter/opposing statement to whatever the intrusive thought is saying. When the thought is more severe, I would show physical tic like reactions as an attempt to deflect it."
Living_Pin_2781,35,"It may sound obvious but hmh hear my situation out: so like, these days I got so used to these thoughts I can like ""sense"" an intrusive thought coming sometimes. And I would show a physical reaction to this such as by sudden twitches/jerking of my arms or neck, squinting my eyes hard, etc. which often somehow deflects these thoughts from actually materializing. However, today- suddenly- I 'sensed' an intrusive thoughts coming again so I started having physical reactions to it again but then an intrusive thoughts just blurted out in my mind very strongly and clearly despite this and it's freaking me out because of how strongly it came and like how strongly it sounded like me (like obviously but like I almost couldn't tell if it was my own voice-thought or my intrusive thought). The thought was also structured a bit more differently than the usual ones. God, why did it suddenly change up like this? And why couldn't my usual physical tics deflect it?"
Living_Pin_2781,35,"What I mean is, I remembered and started obsessing over a particular something I did/happened in the past that I know was real. But then, a few moments later, I started remembering something else I did right after that that kinda redeemed or dissolved the fear involved in the first memory I was obsessing over. But now my intrusive thoughts are thinking 'what if this reassuring memory I suddenly remembered shortly after the obsessive memory is a false memory I unconsciously created to cope with or deny the events of the obsessive memory?' And this thought kinda freaks me out and I'm really unsure if this reassuring memory is false or not solely created for the purpose of reassurance..."
Living_Pin_2781,35,"So I was replaying the South Park: Fractured but whole game... And holy shit my intrusive thoughts won't shut the hell up. So like, I was starting it all over again, and at the beginning of the game everyone assumes the player is a dude (later on you can choose your gender) so everyone refers to the player as he/him. But like, since it's a video game and shit, I- of course- did not feel any discomfort towards it or anything. But like my intrusive thoughts all the while through was like 'oh you don't feel discomfort because that's actually who you are.' Like holy fuck, it's a freaking video game, it shouldn't matter if I'm playing as a dude character or a female character, why does it keep associating everything to myself. And like when I get excited or kinda happy because the game is fun, suddenly my intrusive thoughts come back with 'see? you're happy and excited rn because you are playing as a boy.' It fucking destroys that whole wow this game is so fun mood TT  Usually when I play video games, I tend to play as dudes more but now I can't even do that because every time I do my intrusive thoughts kick in... Does this happen to y'all too?"
mickNcheez,23,"So I’ve had the suicidal ocd theme for a while and I can’t express how much anxiety it’s given me, more so with the urges to want to do it even though I really really don’t want to! I’m trying to do what I’m supposed to by either remaining uncertain but I keep getting intrusive feelings and checking my emotions   So mainly my question is, to people that have gotten over this theme how did you do it and what’s the best thing to do to get better?"
BBlank223,1,"So was masturbating cause hypersexual, yay. Anyway went to reading fanfic smut, went to a pairing, accidentally came across a taboo one, well in the fic one of the people had a thought the dismissed it as an intrusive thought, he still went through with having sex with the other person.  It gave me more intrusive thoughts about what if when I have sexual intrusive thoughts I actually want them? I hate this. Brain problems."
turquoiseturtle01,5,I have a grandma in her 90s. She is developing dementia. My grandma can’t be alone at home so she gets scared and confused. Whenever my mom has to run errands I watch my grandma since she can’t go places with the pandemic going on. My grandma has become extremely difficult which causes too much pressure and stress on me. Most of the time she makes moaning noises and keeps calling my moms name. It has come to the point where she makes those noises that I get headaches and my head starts to tingle. I also start to get obsessive thoughts with my OCD from the stress. I’m at the point where I can’t even have a social life and unsure what to do with finding a job because of the challenges with my grandma. My OCD keeps increasing because I’m being put into too much pressure and responsibilities.
littledaisy_07,8,Long story short. I’ve been diagnosed with OCD since March. My mother doesn’t believe in therapy and thinks I’m only still feeling bad because I’m not trying hard enough. I told her I was feeling better to please her but that’s not true. I feel depressed alongside my regular OCD symptoms and my therapist says my OCD is very resistant. What should I do to prepare this appointment correctly? I don’t want to make her think I’m not doing enough but I also don’t want to lie  (She’s coming with me to plan exposures)
shadowXXe,44,To think that earlier this year was the worst of it.  it was just the calm before the storm. TOCD and ROCD are hitting me hard it feels like my entire self identity is disintegrating before me like I don't even recognise myself anymore.  it feels as if everything is out of my control.  But I have hope as always that things will eventually get better although my themes seem to be lasting longer so I might be in this one for the long haul
Living_Pin_2781,35,"I kept getting weird sensation on my bosom area and I keep overthinking and coming to like very far fetched and abrupt conclusion of 'what if it's breast cancer?' This is driving me to keep ruminating on the internet for symptoms though I know the internet is the worst place to search up for disease symptoms and like I keep checking and making sure I don't have any of these symptoms. And then because I'm paying more attention to these small zapping pain, it starts to happen more often and that increases my anxiety even more. God, why can't I just shrug it off TT Though tbh I've been going crazy over my health ever since I was young... But I was doing so much better with this theme, why is it coming back again TT  Sorry for the vent TT It's just that with TOCD, HOCD, Magical Thinking OCD and Sexual OCD (having conquered harm OCD in the past) it's already tough enough...

mavavilj,40,"How long have you had OCD?  My insight varies, but at this point I think I am at 5 years mark already. I read some paper that said that median is around 7 years though (and there are cases of 20-40 years) so I'm not surprised yet that I wasn't in < 12 months group."
mavavilj,40,"Anyone else found professional help not as useful as peer?  I used to believe that doctors surely should know this stuff, but lately I've thought that I'm making much more progress by listening to myself, rather than research advice.  Why? Because research advice does not answer to individual variables.  Research can be used to find variables, but it will not tell which variables you should individually tune."
Living_Pin_2781,35,"I used to love making up random scenarios in my head and playing those out with like characters I just made up or that already exists that I like. But after my OCD got very bad, doing this becomes very difficult. Like somehow my OCD or intrusive thoughts finds way to make this playing around very discomforting so like now this one source of joy I had is kinda taken away from me... Does anybody else experience this?"
turquoiseturtle01,5," I’m in my early 20s and missing being a child and teenager. I’ve been dealing with a lot of traumas these past few years and missing the simpler years where I didn’t have to worry about being triggered and stressed. I’m struggling as a young adult and still figuring things out but everything is currently confusing. I graduated from college last weekend but still unsure about what career path and other choices to take. It’s especially challenging because of my Autism,  Dyscalculia, and OCD. I’ve been crying a lot because I feel sad how everything has changed so fast and I feel so unprepared about the next steps. I’ve been also ruminating lately on when I was a child and teenager and how I’m trying to remember certain memories but then it ends up been so stressful. There’s also been a lot of personal issues going on in my family and I just wish I could go back to my old teenage and kid self. I also often tend to like fun and innocent things like toys, movies, crafts, and games. Does this possibly sound like age regression with my Autism and OCD?"
turquoiseturtle01,5,Today has been very difficult. I haven’t been able to rest. My mind keeps obsessing and over thinking about new and old things. It’s making me feel anxious. I’m struggling with letting go of the past and struggling with trying to ignore flaws in things. My mind keeps also creating hallucinations and images when I open and close my eyes. I want to be able to do the tasks that I need to do around the house and do my fun hobbies but these obsessive thoughts and images keep me from enjoying things. I also still keep getting headaches and head tingles and it’s such an annoying feeling.
turquoiseturtle01,5,Today I’ve been feeling really restless. My overthinking has been keeping me from resting and sleeping. I’ve been getting up down a lot today and keep getting distracted from my tasks around the house. I’ve been feeling really spacey where I stare off into space and I keep getting closed and opened eye hallucinations. My also feel sore and I have circles around my eyes. My head is aching and I keep getting tingles on my head from overthinking. I have also been feeling sensitive to bright lights and keep getting after images from the lights when I close and open my eyes and I worry about that turning into an aura migraine.
Living_Pin_2781,35,"What am I to you? You see me shrivelled up in my own filth, observing the enormous flies gliding by-pupils darting left and right- like vultures with the backdrop of a burning gold eye, scrutinizing me constantly. Doesn't this infuriate you? A jumble of paroxysm of all kinds of emotions: a mash of thorny roses slithering around your heart, its thorns dutifully digging into our hearts... while the glistening marbles of blue rolling down our cheeks... Poor you.  The flies... They keep coming at you don't they? ""God? Please, why is this happening?"" But the eye... Oh that holy red sun... There is an eclipse. A veil of darkness is drawn, but the flies have learned to shine through. More marbles roll down your cheeks. With a clang, they bounce and roll over the sordid floor.  Who defines the line between sanity and insanity? Though we say there is no clear answer to such a question, there are clear judges of who decides such things. And when there are such judges, there comes- though illusionary- certain answers. Answers, all just pierced against pins of lies, as if there is any kind of certainty in this world.  I remembered- clutching and fidgeting with those azure marbles- that Hume had once thought ""How are we sure that the sun will rise the next day? *Because the sun had always risen back. Remember?* But how does that truly *guarantee* that the sun will rise again tomorrow??"" Everything is just a mirage, veil upon veil upon veil... Blue filters clouding the sky where the flies continue to buzz by. Is the only real thing then, those flies?  *I pity the immortals, I pity the Gods.* Then I remember, for a brief flash of light, what it was like before the flies set in. Before the roses tarnished what was once so dear, before the marbles started dropping, before the flies started to fill up the attic of my mind... Those flies... They are just minuscule nothing... Small insects buzzing by to go on living, jerking off and to perish. It's nothing. And then, for that brief instance, the marbles- they stop. Am I finally fre-  Oh poor you! Oh poor you! Everything behind a fog like the veil of a widow, the eclipse never ceases. The universe plunged into eternal Night... We are submerging under those glistening pearls of azure again, no wonder the flies look like monsters....  The thorns, as if parasites, they flourish upon this terror, while the flies become bigger and the marbles, they start to hit the ceiling, rolling upon one another as there is not enough room left for them... If a God saw me now, it would know what it is like to be human. To see behind a filter of blue, a blue figure drowning in its own attic... Oh poor you... You ugly blue you.  *But, remember? Darkness is merely another form of light. There is no real darkness, everything is light. The world has lost itself in illumination- and that's how the world is going to end.*"
turquoiseturtle01,5,This morning I woke up by overthinking different things. I still keep thinking of things that I used to own from the past and still keep worrying about scratches and other damages on my things. These are two themes that have been bothering me lately and it’s sad that there’s no way for those things to change to they way they used to be with no regrets. Those thoughts and images just keep popping up in my mind and vision at random times which ends up distracting me from doing tasks and hobbies. When I start to overthink/obsess over those things I get headaches with tingles and blurry vision with open and close eye hallucinations.
Living_Pin_2781,35,"I was watching a movie and like legit this dude in the movie was just talking about someone else and said 'he' and like my mind went full on 'ok if this is applied to me, does it feel uncomfortable or uncomfortable?' (I'm a girl btw). And this kinda freaked me out; like I can't even watch stuff and even hear someone refer to someone else with pronouns without fucking freaking out over it. What is wrong with me. It wasn't this bad before winter break started. I was more under control TT"
Living_Pin_2781,35,Sometimes I would just be watching something and my OCD or intrusive thoughts would be running wildly all the while or just randomly pop out and like just flare up into this very intense feeling. It's making it hard for me to appreciate stuff or enjoy what I'm watching. I try to ignore it but it's so damn frustrating TT
SlipInternational593,47,"(Just a brief disclaimer that this is just my personal opinion, so plz plz just take it with a pinch of salt if it doesn't resonate with you. if not, do stop reading from here on, as I really don't wish to offend anymore with my direct approach in this post. I just need to let this off my chest once and for all.)  So I have been browsing through some reddit, Facebook and Insta posts about OCD, and to be honest, I am quite disappointed with how so many OCD sufferers view OCD recovery as a whole. Now I want understand that this is none of their fault. OCD sucks big time. BIG TIME. My OCD revolves around my harm and false memory themes, but my resulting depression keeps making me think that I will never recover and get out of this sh\*\*hole (sorry for cursing), and unfortunately, one of my compulsions is to also check up whether OCD can be overcome, and that it is not chronic.  *CHRONIC.*  Can I just say that I truly detest, loathe, despise, hate, reject this word. In particular, when it comes to OCD.  I do admit I am an idealist (as opposed to be a realist), but this is a trait that is entirely separate from my OCD/depression. But I truly wonder how much of a help to our recovery if we keep fusing our worth with OCD and then keep having words/phrases like ""chronic"" or ""I just have to manage with it for the rest of my life"" or ""I just have to suck it up, put up with it and be on meds for the rest of my life""   determine our prognosis. This is a genuine question.  I am still struggling with finding an answer to my future. The past 5 years have been nothing but torture. It's meds upon meds, side effects upon side effects. I have put on so much weight that I can barely recognise myself in photos. My belly is protruding and this is so injurious to my already-low self-esteem, and I am very short as a male. I don't think I want to believe in the lofty western medicine (that is tied to big Pharma's commercial interests) any more. Instead, I am considering the more compassionate and soothing Chinese medicine.  I am 25 and a lot of my friends are almost or have graduated from university, getting married and settling down, while I am still here trying to find HOPE and REASON to SURVIVE. The meds that are supposed to help me harm me, my symptoms barely abate, and then when my compulsions compel me to search up recovery stories and words of hope, I keep stumbling upon negative stories that having OCD is akin to having a death sentence (though this is implied implicitly). This came from both sufferers AND doctors. I also wish to say that I did not have a pleasant experience with my country's psychiatrists/therapists at all. They verbally abused me and ignored to see me and my pleas to lower the meds' doses. I developed a dependence on Benzos which are damaging to the body over the long term. This caused me trauma, distrust of these ""professionals"" and mood instability.  Because of all these opinions, I have OD-ed a few times, because I *truly* see no hope at all.  Ultimately, I have no one to blame. People have there opinions on OCD recovery and meds, and I shouldn't blame them at all for my choice to search them up due to my compulsions.  I think that's about it. I'm not sure if any of my paragraphs has resonated with you. For now I'm just depending on content put up by ex-OCD sufferers such as Mark Freeman, Shannon Shy and Ali Greymond for some relief and hope. But I have no course of action because, well, the OCD combined with the side effects of the meds can just leave me bedridden throughout the day.  Because they believe in recovery.  Take care guys."
Living_Pin_2781,35,"It's kinda personal but TOCD actually really made me very honest with myself and appreciate the fact that I am female. In terms of, before TOCD I was very tomboyish and even felt very insecure about being feminine because of- I think- internal mysoginy. But, the problem with this was that it led me to lying to myself a lot. For example, when I first cut my hair very very short. I hated it. But I told myself over and over again I liked it because of pure stupid stubbornness. And I kept at it for a year or so. And I started making exaggerated claims about certain things just to shock others or to reject myself further. But then... TOCD hit. And goddamn, I realized I really really didn't want to be a man: I am female and I want to stay that way. Idk if that makes sense but TOCD drove me to be honest with myself: I finally was able to acknowledge that I didn't like having short hair and that I thought I didn't look good with short hair. It drove me to be less hard on myself when I found myself liking feminine stuff, that it was ok if I found a certain necklace pretty or if there was a skirt or clothing that looked feminine yet appealing to me. After TOCD hit, I realized how hard I was on myself on trying not to be feminine. But then, TOCD made me realize that no, I am a female and I like it.   &#x200B;  Though yes, TOCD is a bitch and it really makes my life difficult- but sometimes, when I'm feeling a bit better, I remember this: the progress I've made in appreciating myself for who I am: that it's ok to be a girl who's feminine."
Living_Pin_2781,35,"Like sometimes I randomly think of a scenario with me (I think) but for some reason, I would have the voice of a guy (I'm a girl btw) or like the outline of a guy.

Living_Pin_2781,35,"I keep sometimes recalling very random things that have happened or that I've done in the past and my intrusive thoughts keep attributing them to the topic of the theme and makes me very anxious and uncomfortable.

DangerousFee4,38,"I just went to the grocery store for food, and there was a guy checking me out at the register. I've struggled with sexual themed thoughts. So try and help me out with this senerio.  Before I get up for the Register, my heart starts beating 3x faster , I start to blush and my breathing becomes harder. As soon I saw the guy. Isn't that signs of sexual attraction?  I'm so confused if I'm gay or not. I'm wondering if I should just try kissing a guy , I'll probably end up liking it.   I have no clue what to do, and because of the doubts I can't hang out with friends anymore. The doubt around my feelings are too strong. My behavior infront of guy is very noticable.

turquoiseturtle01,5,Lately when I watch tv I see closed and open eyed hallucinations of the characters from the movies and shows on the corner of my vision. I start to see the characters from movies and tv shows in my mind and vision in the form of still and moving images when my eyes are opened and closed. This also happens as well when I’m using social media that certain images or videos get focused on that those hallucinations happen. Do I need to stop watching tv and movies and social media because of the opened and closed eye hallucinations or do I still keep using them for exposure?

And like it's very uncomfortable because along with this strange hyperawareness/sensation there, I keep getting visuals of like the male reproductive system (so like intrusive thought linking physical sensation with it so like it's extra distressing and harder to ignore). And like it's so discomforting and uncomfortable. I hate this so much but the sensation is just there and it freaks me out.   &#x200B;  HOCD + TOCD + Sexual OCD is not fun :((("
Living_Pin_2781,35,"Like idk when I'm under much stress/heavy anxiety, I become very snappy and just sad or angry deep inside because of how anxious/stressed I am. Today like, it really wasn't big deal but my sister said some things and I got so angry for some reason and snapped. I felt super guilty and apologized afterwards... Then quickly realized that I wasn't really angry at her but more at myself. Angry and mad at how anxious and stressed I am over these intrusive thoughts, angry that I need to deal with this everyday. I guess I just snapped when even the most minimal trigger offered a chance for that anger to be let out.   &#x200B;  Thinking about it, maybe that also explains why I keep crying randomly over the smallest triggers. I don't think I was upset by that trigger in itself but more because it pricked or gave an opportunity for that kinda underlying sadness over me being constantly anxious and all that burden kinda letting itself out.   &#x200B;  God, OCD sucks."
PeteyZee1998,24," I have no anxiety to leave home but more so it stems from living with bats. I have lots of bats outside on my neighbours treee and they fly low over my porch to get to the fruit. They have the sound of Batman flying and are almost as big as pterodactyl. I feel so paralyszed and obsessed. I keep thinking why can’t I have a normal life or normal household. What if I go outside? I run the risk of getting attacked and getting rabies. I’m glued inside my home from dusk to dawn because their presence is destroying my life. It’s summer and I’m living it in hell. I can’t move or afford a new home untill I get into housing.   They are grey headed flying foxes.  This is only a issue from December to March, so 3 months I need to put up with this??? I have gatherings scheduled for 2022, how will I return home at 11 pm without encountering them and requiring rabies shots??? They carry lyssavirus and rabies"
Living_Pin_2781,35,"Someone I know just came out bi and she told me how she came to realize it and now I'm going back through my whole past. Apparently for her, she had mistaken attraction for admiration. What if I am the same? Because I know I am able to feel aesthetic appreciation for all (in terms of, I could look at a girl and go 'woah she's very pretty' without really feeling anything), but is that attraction?"
turquoiseturtle01,5,"My paranoia about theft has returned. Since it is December with Christmas coming up, I am worried again about thieves targeting my family and neighbors. There has been a huge increase in my town with home break-ins, car break ins, business burglaries, and package/mail thefts lately. I get packages and important mail often and worry about thieves stealing from me. I am home most of the days but on rare occasions I sometimes go out for errands with my mom or go places with friends and worry about thieves trying to break into my house or steal mail/packages. I have a security alarm with cameras but still worry too that thieves could try to take that as well. Theft is a big fear of mine. I dint thieves to take advantage of my family and I, especially since there are families in my house with disabilities and dint want something traumatic like that to happen."
turquoiseturtle01,5,"I’ve been triggered again by the things I own being scratched. I have been obsessed and triggered by this since May about those things because there was some traumas happening around that time which affected me. I am so careful that my electronics and other things don’t get scratched but certain things that have screens or made of plastic still end up scratched. I’m not rough with those things and I don’t understand why those things would still end up scratched. When I see scratches I start to panic because even the smallest or biggest scratch is noticeable to me and doesn’t look right because it looks sloppy and incomplete . I can feel my heart racing and my head starts to hurt. I start to obsessively get thoughts and images of the scratches in my mind of what those things looked without scratches. I wish I could figure out how to remove the scratches but I don’t know how even though there are hacks online on how to remove scratches but I dint want the scratches to end getting worse. I just wish I had a second chance to have those things back to their original form without the scratches, especially since I’m so responsible with taking care of those things. If I stop obsessing and being triggered by scratches, is it possible for the scratches to go away naturally on their own or are those scratches still going to be on my things permanently?"
Living_Pin_2781,35,"sometimes when i look at specific characters of the opposite sex, I get a quick thought saying 'i want a beard' or 'I want hair on my leg like that'- and these thoughts makes me feel so uncomfortable it triggers my physical tick like reactions. Are these intrusive thoughts or am I in denial? The thing is like though I was a very tomboyish girl growing up, I never ever wanted to be a guy or questioned my own gender identity. Sure, I did want to look more boyish and masculine and actually kinda was amused when people mistook me for a guy, but the thing is I took pride in the fact that despite all this, I am a girl. Like I always knew that despite my kind of dislike of my own breasts and feminine things, I liked being biologically female. But because of TOCD my thoughts are being muddled and I keep looking into the past and being scared that my tomboyish and kinda eccentric interests and ways that i've presented myself may mean that I am actually a boy but in denial or something. This scares me so much. Sure, I did enjoy being mistook for a boy and looking more neutral, but I don't actually identify myself as a male- it's just not me. It doesn't feel right for me. I want to be a girl, I want to stay as a girl. I was so sure of my gender identity and was proud about how I presented myself in ways that showed 'I don't give a crap about feminine or masculine, I'm biologically female and i present myself however i want' even a few months ago... And here I am now... TT"

Living_Pin_2781,35,"Basically, I had an intrusive thoughts (visual one) but I was somewhat very zoned out so I didn't feel any anxiety or show any reaction towards that thought until I suddenly zoned back in and realize the content/what the visuals of that intrusive thoughts was.

Does the fact that I felt so neutral/didn't show any reaction till when I zoned back in mean that this wasn't an intrusive thought?"
mavavilj,40,"Anyone have difficulties in deciding between work and leisure? Or e.g. finding difficult to stay focused on work?  I wonder what's the medicine for this, so that I would not continue with ""avoidance behavior""?  It almost feels like Pavlovian:  * perceived ""harmful stimuli"" (work) * avoid that stimuli in order to avoid supposed pain  I also have this w.r.t. to some people:  * perceived undesirable person * avoid that person  Exposure? Push yourself towards work bits at a time until ""work during work time"" becomes the norm again? Maybe, but if it feels painful to do (due to the conditioning above)?"

NameIntrepid,9,"I do not feel anything like myself at all. I can’t even recognize myself because my thoughts make me feel like a completely different person. They have gotten so bad and are just nonstop. They feel so damn real and I can’t differentiate them from actual thoughts. I don’t know what to do anymore, I feel lost ;(."
turquoiseturtle01,5,"These past few days I couldn’t stop thinking about things I used to own that made me happy from my childhood and from my teenage years. I kept getting obsessive thoughts and images of the clothes, movies, toys, and jewelry that I used to have that I gave away too soon in a rush without fully thinking through. Now I completely regret giving though things that had special memories away by donating them to thrift stores and selling them in yard sales. I keep getting random thoughts that they still might be saved in storage or around my home but when I check they aren’t there because my mind thinks that I have those things saved. I start to have thoughts where my mind researches what they exactly look like and then I try to look all over the Internet which then turns stressful trying to buy those because of the prices and sellers. All of these thoughts become so stressful because then I that’s all I start to think about and then it’s also hard for me to sleep and do daily tasks because those thoughts distract me. All I wish for is all the things I gave away to return so that so could have a second chance. Is that possible? How can those things I miss come back? A lot of these thoughts also come from traumas these past few years that have caused me these thoughts and I am hoping to have some happiness back with a second chance to enjoy those things that have some memories. It makes me feel so sad I won’t be able to see those things again and it causes me grief."
Living_Pin_2781,35,"In terms of, can they juggle multiple themes at the same time? I hear a lot about people who's past OCD theme dies down because they have now moved on to another theme. But is it still considered oCD, or even possible that- instead of moving on from one theme- your intrusive thoughts/OCD starts juggling several themes at once? So at one point one would experience HOCD thoughts then the next day they would experience Harm OCD thoughts, etc.?"
Living_Pin_2781,35,"Hey, so the thing is- if I must put a label on it- I think I am something like a straight-asexual? Eh, I don't really enjoy putting on labels but basically I never felt sexual or romantic attraction before (I don't think) but I can imagine myself- and am comfortable- with a man in the future and such. The thing is though I do get aesthetic attraction/appreciation, where it's more like I am able to acknowledge or be in awe of aesthetic/outline of appearances but that is very different from sexual or romantic attraction as it is more of a admiration or attraction of the visual factors that does not involve anything like 'oh I wanna fuck that person' or 'oh I wanna spend the rest of my life with that person.' (if this makes any sense...). Also I had a phase where i tried experimenting and thus was very briefly in a relationship with a friend but then that made me very uncomfortable and I realized that I wasn't gay. So, after that I had no questions about my sexuality and it was established that i was more or less straight (and ace). But then, from few months ago, these intrusive thoughts started coming about whether I was gay or not. and like it doesn't make sense because I thought that one experience made it pretty clear that i wasn't. But for some reason these thoughts keeps disturbing me and scaring me: now I am afraid I may be feeling false attraction towards a fictional female character, but idk if it is or not (because I have never felt attraction in the past i can't even tell what it is- but like it winged close to anxiety?)."
littledaisy_07,8,"So, I’ve been diagnosed with severe OCD for 9 months. For a few weeks now, I’ve been feeling extremely down - as if I’d never experience happiness ever again. I feel unmotivated for my daily tasks. Does that mean I’m depressed? And if so, is it common when you suffer from OCD?"
Living_Pin_2781,35,"I kinda tried to combat my OCD and social anxiety by finally getting the guts to put up a comment in a youtube video. But for some reason, instead of this 'exposure' actually helping, my intrusive thoughts are using it to make me feel more anxious and uncomfortable... Should I just delete it in this case or should I try to fight this discomfort?"
Living_Pin_2781,35,"The thing is i went through this exact same thing few months back and was able to finally come to term with it and tolerate the uncertainty. But for some reason it's rising back again... So like, there's this girl who's my friend. But like I suddenly randomly got like a quick visual of me and her being romantic and I got really uncomfortable with it but now I'm like again kinda panicking over it. Like the thing is now, when I'm near her or talk to her I get physical reactions such as sweating too. And like I get intrusive thoughts like 'oh you find her hot.' or 'you're gay bc actually you have a crush on her': things like that. The thing is though, before it got bad again, I did feel like a desire: but NOT a romantic or sexual desire, it was like a desire or willingness to spend more time with her as platonic friends. Bc we are friends but I didn't really get to spend a lot of time with her bc she is a pretty busy person. But-like what I hope is HOCD- now my thoughts are twisting that and keeps telling me that I have a romantic crush on her. But I don't want to be and it makes me feel so uncomfortable and scared... Is this HOCD or am I in denial??"

Living_Pin_2781,35,"I was watching this show and it kinda touched upon a theme which I am currently having intrusive thoughts about.

How do you get past these situations when it gets flared up again because of a trigger?"
Living_Pin_2781,35,"Like, sometimes when I think back to the past and find a memory that serves as reassurance/or kinda helps me realize that whatever my intrusive thoughts is saying is not true, suddenly I would then question 'what if this is a false memory my mind made up subconsciously in order to feel reassurance and I'm just in denial of whatever my intrusive thoughts are saying?' So like could it be that this is an actual real memory but my intrusive thought is making me doubt its reality/validity, or is it a false memory I subconsciously thought up of for reassurance and actually I am indeed in denial??? And how would I be able to tell??"

PeteyZee1998,24,"   I have a fruit tree in my backyard, and my neighbour has a fruit tree, 3 steps from my porch.

I was almost bitten and scratched if it wasn't for the presence of my uber driver.  My quality of life is at a low point where i am losing interest to enjoy my summer, i feel absolutely down, i just keep thinking a bat will attack me, i excessively obsess about the bats, and i can't really concentrate at night because the only thing i feel is anxiety and a feeling of doom. I don't know where and who to turn to.  I just wanna go outside freely, enjoy my summer, have fun, without feeling severe anxiety every night due to these creatures"

I kept obsessing over what they looked like because I kept getting images in my mind and vision.

It also cause me to struggle with sleeping because they also appeared in my dreams."
turquoiseturtle01,5,I got a new phone case last week. I have been taking really good care of it. I have been extremely cautious with it not getting scratched when I touch it and put it down. Today I found a small scratch when the light in my room shined on it. I panicked when I saw the scratched and it triggered my OCD. I got a tingling feeling in my head and can’t stop getting images in my head of the small scratch on the phone case. It’s causing me so much anxiety. I dint know how to remove the scratch on the new  phone case and I know I can’t return it to the store since it’s already out of the box and in use.

rioboy1985,37,"I was with a girl all day yesterday. It was great to be with her. We had a lot of fun. But at the end of the night my OCD kicked in and I sat there for an hour asking her over and over if I had done anything wrong with her, then asking her to repeat her answers. She was amazingly gracious with me . She said she had never met anyone with OCD. She could see how tormenting it is.  But this is how it ALWAYS starts. They show me grace but over time the patience grows thin. I need to keep focused on this journey to freedom and say ""f*ck it"". But it's truly terrifying.  My ex gf is so happy with her new guy. She took me back last year but would be really mean and tell me to go back to Ireland (I'm in Brazil). She said, ""you're the only person I treat badly"". How am I supposed to get better when she says this kinda thing ? I'm so sorry for everything I put her through with my OCD but it wasn't intentional and if I could cut it out like cancer I'd love to.   Anyway, feeling sh*tty today. I want to have a normal mind"

shadowXXe,44,Hello everyone. Every since I started college my sleep schedule has become practically non existent. And I'm always tired. This has coincided with a worsening of the symptoms of my OCD so is it possible that my poor sleep schedule is to be for my worsening OCD?
Living_Pin_2781,35,"I'm not the kind of person to cut off someone just like that. I hate the idea of doing that as I hate any kind of conflict. However, I'm in a situation where I feel like I should. So basically, I knew this person for a long while (almost 4 years) and knew her in real life too. However, now she went off to college so now we only have social media to contact each other. But anyways, we got close over the years and built a nice friendship where we felt safe enough to confide to each other personal things and all and were always there for each other... Until... Well, she started to gradually act strange. In the sense that, she started to become- I don't think she realizes it- extremely passive aggressive even in very casual conversation and almost always super defensive after stating her own opinions. And it's not like I was disagreeing (like saying her opinions are invalid or something) with her opinions or arguing with her: we could literally be talking about our communication preferences and she would suddenly go through all this whole essay long explanation to why her views make the most sense and passive aggressively shut down my own opinions/preferences if it did not align with hers. She's also very very politically correct and combined with her black and white stubbornness it doesn't help and talking about politics in some ways is unavoidable. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells every time I talk to her because of her severely politically correct views. I'm scared I'll say something accidentally insensitive and trigger another essay long response that is more black and white than have really any substance to it in which we both can learn from. I've been trying to tolerate it and understand her as, from what she had confided me in the past, she went through a very difficult and rough past and also had many mental disorders and all. But, I realized that I can't do this anymore. Every time we have a conversation online I feel so drained, weary and just kinda angry as well. Every time I do feel this anger my intrusive thoughts comes on and triggers my compulsions and stuff. After those conversations, I can't escape her: she's constantly in my mind and I constantly feel a bit frustrated and unhappy.  So, I recently tried to distance myself from her. I started to reply to her late, did not initiate conversations and even turned off notifications with her chat. But, because we were once so close, I can't escape her. And every time I worry over how I can cut off contacts with her or how I can be free from her. But I'm too cowardly to do a confrontation and I get sometimes like scenarios of her like realizing something's off and confronting me about it and me having to tell her all... Idk, I just feel miserable and I feel like me holding onto this friendship is so unhealthy but at the same time I don't think she realizes that she's making me feel like this and she seems to really treasure our friendship.  Idk, she's kinda condescending usually as well. So like I couldn't even bring up the topic about me having OCD because I was scared she would dismiss me or be offended by me claiming that my therapist thought that I had OCD.  Am I overthinking all this?  PS. I also kinda feel guilty even writing and posting this... God, Im really not sure what to do."

For example, those thoughts would be like ""what if if I have my back turned for too long in the dark kitchen, the horror thing in that video game would appear and kill me?"" Of course it's complete nonsense, but while knowing that I would get so damn crept out about it and like I would actually go on full anxiety/alert mode (fast heartbeat, rise in sensitivity towards any types of noise, constant vigilance, etc.) almost as if I believed it to be true. So like then I would need to actually do what my thoughts say and like constantly look back and like make sure i don't have my back turned for too long in the dark kitchen (in the scenario of the given example).

PeteyZee1998,24,"I have a big phobia of bats. Aka grey headed flying foxes.   I feel the need to have constant exposure to them by deliberately going outside at night so that I can somehow “keep them away from ever entering my house””  By going outside I feel I’m performing some ritual and that’s keeping them away from my home. Of course only one such reported incident has happened in my country because these are large bats not micro bats.   2 days ago I was picking up my food as I was almost swooped by one. A part of me fears the bats know about me and if I don’t go outside some matrix in the universe will send them to my house,   I sound like a schizophrenic but I’m really really far gone into my nonsense obsessive thoughts"

BBlank223,1,"so idk if this rant belongs here or not, but anyway my mom and brother don't understand ocd, i never really get along with my brother, used to when we were kids, but apperantly im at fault for it, cause im supposed to take it when he calls me names and be over it, but i don't work like that, im also very scared of him cause he has threatened to harm me and apparently im supposed to not have any fear or be scared even when my mom tried to make us get along, i was abit stand offish in that, meaning that i didn't really know how to respond to him being nice, but i was being civil back, i also isolate myself aswell, so usually i don't want to talk, and that parts my fault, but i did try being civil both of them wanted me to be all buddy buddy after agreeing to be nice.  i mean i snapped at him earlier cause i felt abit attacked cause he told me not to wash my hands, i literally hear myself in my head and from my mom enough that i get annoyed by it when im told not to, i also told him it wasn't his business when i wash my hands(mostly cause he gets mad if i get the slightest bit in his) i mean i know sometimes i can be blunt and not really there emotionally tbh, but like twoish weeks ago my mom talked to my brother and he tried again to be nice showed me his leather jacket for this trip he was taking with friends.  he got upset cause i wasnt receptive of it, meaning i didn't really have a reaction or opinion of it, and then he kept repeating over and over what my mom said to him, i don't really remember it.  i just know im emotionally numb or anxious all the time, there is very little time where im actually happy, i try to explain my problems and how i feel, but it feels liek they dont care enough to listen, i do know i have things to apologize for aswell, and i may have threw out that i am owed an apology for things they did, even though my mom did, my mom also said my brother did aswell, but like i don't remember if he did, and i think i would. my moms apology also felt half-assed thinking about it now.  it was ""sorry for whatever i did to hurt you in the past"" but i started getting over ti anyway cause i knew she really wouldn't remember what she did tbh, and i know my brother doesnt either, but i really don't remember and explicit apology either but tbh my mom thinks an apology would fix everything, mostly cause i threw that into the argument earlier cause she wouldn;t listen and said i never tried.  and most of the stuff i have a problem with, cause she said i have a problem with stuff that happened 10 years ago(she doesnt want to listen and and if i bring up soemthing from the past it's usually something that happened in the recent amount of at most a year) and stuff that keeps repeating.  i feel invalidated cause she tells me to try to understand his mental health and understand him calling me names and being rude for no reason sometimes, is cause of it. but when i accidentally say something wrong cause i have no brain to mouth filter and or i think what i say is okay(probably isnt dont really understand sometimes) im in the wrong.  im tired of it cause im told i never try, but when i try im stand offish cause i have trust issues, i have literally no friends and i feel stuck in this loop of everything happening over and over and maybe im the problem. but it feels like all my problems ae real, but at the same time im told im being overdramatic, and i think i am sometimes to.  i also feel like the reason sometimes the arguments get out of hand is cause no one cares enough to listen cause they are tired of it. but the reason the same problem comes up is cause it happens over and over again.  yea this time it was my fault and it was when it happened two days ago, but i literally wasn't okay and haven't been for awhile but apparently cause im the more ""sane"" one its always my fault."
Living_Pin_2781,35,"Like it's kinda disturbing, I feel like if I focus too hard on the sensation I'm gonna end up having a panic attack because the thoughts somehow try to link its content with the burning sensation. Goddamnit, I have to wait till next Wednesday to talk to my therapist again..."
Living_Pin_2781,35,"So the thing is I did have a brief exploration phase but quickly realized that I was straight. But the thing is, recently I just saw this random picture of a woman- I am a girl btw- and like I had a thought of ""she looks hot"" shoot out. And then I started getting scared and panicking over it. Like did I actually mean that? I don't want to be gay and I've already experimented in the past and really realized that I wasn't. So like why did this thought show up? I don't even feel any physical attraction for women, so like why did that thought suddenly pop out? Am I in denial? Oh god... And Im not even quite done with my previous OCD topic TT  &#x200B;  The thing is though this topic sometimes comes and goes and it's not very consistent mainly because there's another big topic that my OCD is more fixed upon these days... Please tell me this is just an intrusive thought... I know I shouldn't seek for reassurance but Im kind of scared.  &#x200B;  Im currently trying to distract myself from slipping into overthinking this too much but like I keep going back to it..."
Living_Pin_2781,35,"I finally got to talk to my therapist about some of my intrusive thoughts I was afraid of talking about and also asked her if she thought I had OCD. And well yeah, she does believe this to be OCD and my intrusive thoughts were truly intrusive thoughts. So, I guess knowing what I'm experiencing properly is a step forward to finding a way to get better."
turquoiseturtle01,5,Today I tried charging my phone in the wall and the charging cord isn’t letting me charge my phone. I keep plugging the charging the cord in and out of the wall charging port and it keeps charging and uncharging with the charging sound going on and off. This is a charging cord that I’ve had for awhile and have been very careful with it. I also keeps having to plug and unplug the charging block and it keeps doing the same thing. I also tried an extra charging cord and block and it’s still having issues with charging. I had a meltdown with frustration and anxiety from the chargers not working. I also screamed and cried. I can’t stop thinking about the phone charger because I wish I wasn’t having any issues with it. I need my phone to charge so that I can text my friends and in case of an emergency I need my phone to work. I have also ordered new charger cords and bricks from Amazon and Target and I hope they work when they arrive. I hope the shipping is fast.
Sommet_,22,"I am going to start my laundry soon but have serious trouble with completing it. How do I manage this? I want to get back to the way kind of was. My OCD has always been severe but these past couple of months it’s been eating me away. I can’t even buy anything from stores because I feel that someone pees in or on the products. If you see my past posts, you can see how much of hell I’ve been in."
littledaisy_07,8,"I think I succeeded but I’m not sure. I had to touch a doorknob and not wash my hands straight after. I touched the doorknob in therapy, went back home afterwards, cuddled with my cat and only washed my hands after that. I think it was what I had to do. The anxiety felt awful and very high but I’m glad I did it. The only thing is that I washed my hands twice after hugging my cat"
NameIntrepid,9,I feel this overwhelming feeling that I’m fake and I can’t get over it because it’s so strong. The last few weeks have been especially hard and I just keep spiraling out of control. I hate this shit so much I want to feel okay.
rioboy1985,37,"I hope Dr Penzel doesn't mind me posting this, but a while back I asked him through email to make a post about Legal OCD, where you are so obsessed about the law and going to jail etc. This was his excellent response :  ""This is, as you say, quite common.  It is known as Moral Scrupulosity, and is also related to Religious Scrupulosity.  These are both subgroups of Compulsive Perfectionism.  All OCD is treated the same, and in actuality, the subject matter is actually irrelevant.  All that really matters is how you treat it.  I think too much emphasis is placed on the content of obsessions - they are essentially meaningless, and should just be treated rather than analyzed.  I might get around to writing about it at some point, although I have a killer schedule.  Thanks for the suggestion, in any case.  Best - Dr. Penzel""  Guys, treat the underlying condition and don't worry too much about the theme. Treating the underlying OCD will solve the issue"
RockyK96,36,"My thoughts are further away and no longer torturing me every second which is a big plus! but now theres all this open space and time that would usually be spent on obsessions/compulsions and it’s leaving me extremely bored. It’s like i’m not used to being at peace and am having to adjust to this new state of mind. I know I need to practice mindfulness and being in the moment but it’s more uncomfortable than I would have thought. Does anyone else experience this or understand what I mean, how do you cope?"
Living_Pin_2781,35,There are just certain thoughts Im really scared to share because I'm so scared that it turns out not to be intrusive and that the content of those thoughts turn out to be true... I know it's irrational but like I really have a hard time bringing myself to say it...
DangerousFee4,38,"No core values, no morals, confusion, doubts, anxiety, depression, mood swings, personality disorder....my own brain ruined my life.   So close to ending it all.   This is the most disgusting thing that could happen to a human.   My feelings, thoughts, behaviors are all affected. There's nothing I can do instead just be a fuckin piece of shit and misserable."
Living_Pin_2781,35,"I'm not religious, however, I do keep engaging in these 'prayer' like things (I basically recite all of my intrusive thoughts content but basically say that those things won't happen/aren't true, etc.) for one of my compulsions. I do this every night before everyone sleeps and say one for my father and mother and then say goodnight at the end of the prayer with 'everything will be ok.' (Idk I need to say this or I feel too anxious at night). But, apparently, I've been growing more aggressive when doing this according to my family, like in terms of gesticulation of my arms and just twitching and even just behavior wise. Apparently I get more excitable but in a more aggressive way. Is this normal?"
DangerousFee4,38,"Knowing what you went through, would you still have children?"
DangerousFee4,38,"For the longest time , i have the ability to feel other people's emotions and put myself in someones else position to feel what they are feeling. Is that natural empathy? Maybe extremely empathetic? It's too the point where if I'm even watching a porno I can literally feel what the person is going thru in that scene. If I watch a guy whos gay , I start to feel gay and literally my prescription changes and my whole world seems gay now.   It's like I take the personality of the character or person I'm watching.    I can't function anyone , cause my identity is constantly changing. Like for example, when I go to the therapist I can already pretty much gather what she's going to say before she does. It's like I'm smarter then she is , with the years of experience compared to her 6 years of schooling.   How does schooling even compare to real life experience? Life is incredibly confusing and everyone is on a different path, maybe that's why life is filled with questions.   Like a 20 yr old could experience more then a 30 year old even in less time. But why? Everyones perception is different, so is mental illness even real?     When Im watching a murder true crime show, I can literally feel the raw emotions and out myself in his shoes. Is this common? Is this ocd? What is this. I'm not great at explaining myself, but does anyone understand what I'm trying to describe.    My way of thinking is just extremely off compared to others. Im fully aware of what's going on , witch I believe makes it worse. Some people aren't as aware of their mental illness as I am.    I'm not hearing voices or have hallucinations. I'm dianosed with ocd and anxiety."
rioboy1985,37,"Who's with me guys? I'm f#cking sick of this sh*t! I'm sick of losing everything good in my life. I'm sick of spending hours reading and rereading the same texts messages, knowing what they say, then ruminating on them the next day and thinking ""what if it said something else??""  I want my girlfriend back and to show her I can treat her like the beauty she is!   I know OCD is all bullsh*t. It's like a pile of cars driving down the freeway and YOU decide to pull off into a car park and just do circles for hours. Everyone else keeps on to where they are going and you're literally going in circles (compulsions and rumination). It doesn't make ANY sense and only when we stop ruminating and doing compulsions do we see this!   Let's say ""no"" to rumination and ""yes"" to freedom. It's SCARY to let go of having to 100% understand EVERYTHING, but if others can do it so can we!"
Living_Pin_2781,35,I am questioning everything. And Im scared sometimes what if what I think are intrusive thoughts are just passing thoughts but Im like forcing myself to believe they are intrusive thoughts for reassurance? Am I in denial of what those thoughts say then? stuff like that aaa TT
rioboy1985,37,I wish someone understood me. I'm sick of feeling like a weirdo. When girls get to know me I get scared as I'm afraid of turning them off. I don't want to feel alone anymore. It's horrible
Living_Pin_2781,35,"I'm starting to question a lot of things about me from when I was younger or even some behaviors not so long ago:  For example, when I was in 10th grade I was very convinced one of my friends had a crush on me. But,  I could not stop thinking about this thought and even started to get scared about 'what if I did like them back?' And I kept thinking about it, researching on the internet to see how to know if I liked someone, and trying to see if I matched any of those signs at all, keep on trying to reassure myself by trying to reason with those thoughts by telling it Im straight and that I never had those kinda feeling for them before, etc. The thing is it got so bad that when I did meet them or was near them I started showing physical reactions (such as rapid breathing, perhaps even elevated heart rate) and even had flashes of images or scenes involving me and that friend seemingly being romantic and this freaked me out because i thought then maybe I did like them but was in denial or something. So, I started avoiding them. I started eating lunch in the stairwells where barely anyone goes to. And I even once skipped school because the final class I had was with them and I was afraid they would ask me to walk with them. I even cried and had a breakdown about this several times. I'm not quite sure how I got over this. My memories are fuzzy... But I did. Or more, switched themes...  Oh but I think my first guess that they were interested in me was true as I- 6 months later- randomly recalled an episode I had with them... But when I made that realization that they really might have been interested in me, I had a complete nervous breakdown: rapid breathing, sense of going insane/out of my body, something pressing upon my chest, crying, etc. I was eventually able to calm down and am now pretty much over it but I'm now starting to wonder if this was also somehow OCD related behavior? All of how I have reacted in this?  &#x200B;  Another example, so I don't consider myself spiritual or religious. However, for some reason I can't help but be superstitious. Superstitious in terms of, I sometimes get so obsessed then freaked out about very irrational things I know cannot be true and is absurd but I get freaked out by it and treat it almost as if it could happen. For example, this is why I can't watch horror movies. I know its all fictitious and all that but for some reason this idea that the character in such movie could actually kill me or something keeps coming in and scares me. And it's really weird because I know it's not real but the fear from it is treating it as if this was real. And I can't even really talk about this with anyone because I feel embarrassed and ashamed for almost treating something so absurd like a possible reality.  But now Im really questioning if all of these could have been caused due to OCD? Or if I am trying too hard to tie everything to OCD..."
Living_Pin_2781,35,"Also, though I don't go panic mode all over those intrusive thoughts on days when I'm better, I still do physically twitch/squint my eyes/etc. (But I'm not completely sure if this is exactly OCD related? But I did start showing these physical twitches after all these intrusive thoughts started showing up and overwhelming me for a while...).  But, in terms of mental torture, I am able to recover and get over them quickly (only on days when I'm feeling much better/pretty well)."
Living_Pin_2781,35,I was just wondering if there was a clear difference between the two.
littledaisy_07,8,It won’t stop and it’s super distressing. I don’t dare to talk about it to anyone because of how scary it is and I won’t be seeing my therapist before Wednesday. The thought just feels stuck in my head and my anxiety won’t stop growing. How do I stop please?
BBlank223,1,"so i was reading yaoi manhwa cause like i was in the mood, i stumbled upon kinda like a preview of one, thought it was a bdsm kinda thing, but like i read the yaoi full side story, and it was a full on rape and i kept reading it out of morbid curiousity i guess and from what i read about the main story the guy was also raped mutiple times from a different character aswell, and i just feel aweful for reading it, and fapping at the same time, but like i know i wasn't into it, but my thoughts are trying to convience me i am, anyway i moved on from that story and switched to a more comfortable one.  but like i also heard that the author is trying to justify the rapists and villinaize the victim, like literally she actually believes that the victim was in the wrong.  i hate myself for stumbling upon stuff.  thanks for reading this rant :) have a nice day/night"
rioboy1985,37,"I'm determined to stick this out. But it'd f*cling hell on earth. I want to ""solve"" the problem in my mind, but I need to learn to completely let go of ruminating (trying to solve it) and continue on  To be honest, I'm terrified of stopping seeking reassurance. But after 36 years of this sh!te it's time to knuckle down and choose freedom.  OCD is ALWAYS lies and distortion, and compulsions just feed it.  Please share your recovery process with me so I know I'm not alone folks  I don't have many friends here in Brazil"
turquoiseturtle01,5,"I’ve been under a lot of stress lately. My eyes have been blurry and it almost looks like static and floaters in my vision. I start to space out and overthink/obsess of things that I like and make me stressed. I also sometimes get aura migraines with zigzags and sinus/tension headaches above my eye on the left side and my head tingles from overthinking things. I also have been developing paranoia again since theft have been increasing the area I live in and I worry about thieves trying to target my family and house. I keep getting closed eye hallucinations of my front yard & driveway, front porch, backyard, living room, and bedroom when I close my eyes when I blink, rest, and sleep. I don’t know why I keep getting those closed eye hallucinations and I don’t know how to get rid of them. When I also go on social media and watch tv, I get images of certain things that my mind tries to collect and focus on and I start to see those things when I open and close my eyes. Like for example when I watch cartoons, I can see what’s mirrored from the tv on the left corner side of my eye and start to see the cartoon characters because my mind tries to focus and remember them. Would these images im seeing be considered hallucinations, psychosis, or schizophrenia and would this also be connected to OCD and Autism?"
BBlank223,1,"it was weird, like in the dream i was dating my mom broke up with her and yada yada, im super annoyed cause it was a vivid dream, in the same dream i was shopping for something, some how walked away with chop sticks, thats literally all i remember of the dream tbh, but like i do know that it was all over the place, worst part about it.  is when i was pleasuring myself later i just started having intrusive thoughts about my mom it fucking sucks. i hate my brain, in all honesty i should be taking my meds, and maybe this wouldnt happen but i keep forgetting to.  i also remember accidentally running into this story when i was like 8ish of a mom and son apparently it was a true story idefk, i mean i knew from that age that i was gay tbh. but like i got into alot of fanfic smuts stories and porn and stuff and i kinda wish i can go back and not look into that stuff, cause now i just remember everything i read and stuff.  like i read lesbian smut not really know what was happening but like it make no sense cause im not attracted to girls. i hate myself cause it also ties in with my sexuality ocd stuff. even though im pretty confident about what i know about myself.  is there a way to rewire ones brain? i know there isnt, and i know its gonna be hard to talk about everything i need to in therapy cause i got into some very fucked up smut along the way aswell.  anyway whoever reads my rant, have a nice day/night :)"

mavavilj,40,"Sitting is a trigger, anyone figured out a way to reduce sitting-related lowering of serotonin?  I already figured:  * breaks * maintaining a better posture, e.g. not looking downwards or upwards  But I still find that the whole activity of sitting is problematic. It's the passivity and crookedness to the body that seems to lead to non-optimal breathing and blood flow.  This also leads to compensating effects by:  * drinking more coffee * using more supplements  When I still think the sitting itself is the problem.  But as I work with IT, I sort of have to sit."

sharksandpickles,45,(TW: mentions of su1cide) I have a memory of going to someone's tiktok profile and seeing the aftermath of somebody sh00ting himself. It's very distorted but either way I'm fucking terrified. What if I actually saw it? I remember telling my sister afterwards that it's sick how ppl put videos like that as their profile video. I've also seen a picture before he sh0t himself but it was posted so ppl would avoid seeing it since ppl would post it online to scared others. I also remember my friend saying he saw it but I told him not to show it to me. Now I'm not sure what really happened but I keep crying about it and can't concentrate on my schoolwork anymore.

Hard to start but brings freedom   Source: https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/articles/  ""the only way to eliminate a compulsion is by making the choice to stop doing it.  No other aspect of treatment will make a compulsion go away.  Thus, since rumination is a compulsion, the patient has to directly eliminate it in order to get better.  This might sound obvious, but many people think that some other part of treatment, such as an exposure, is supposed to somehow make the rumination go away, and that will never happen ""  "" Realizing that virtually all thinking related to an obsession is rumination, that rumination is a compulsion, and that a person must therefore directly eliminate rumination in order to feel better is the starting point for getting better from OCD.""  "" For a whole bunch of reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, eliminating rumination only part of the time doesn’t work.  If you want to get better, you will have to eliminate rumination all the time.  Treat this like a deadly allergy, not a diet.""  "" Being too careful: Are you carefully thinking about the decision to stop ruminating each time you have the urge to ruminate?  Carefully considering the decision each time doesn’t work for multiple reasons.  It effectively means you’re ruminating a bit each time, and it also maintains your sense of threat.  It typically also leads to inconsistency. Make the decision to stop ruminating once and then ruthlessly adhere to it"""

I also have been starting to rest and sleep. But today I was under a lot of stress and started to see them same closed eye hallucinations again. I dint if they’ll end up returning or leaving.

It was this really big kit I wanted to get because I really liked the beads and now I can’t stop thinking about them since I now know they aren’t available anymore in store and online. I keep seeing that bead kit in my vision as my eyes and mind have it memorized and my head hurts and tingles from overthinking about it. I did find and buy from Walmart a similar bead kit from that brand but I still can’t stop thinking about that big specific bead kit because my mind is telling me that it’s in complete, especially since that isn’t sold anywhere online.

littledaisy_07,8,"Seriously? I’m tired of hearing my contamination OCD is fake because my main compulsion is washing my hands. That’s debilitating on a daily-basis and sometimes makes it impossible for me to even leave my bedroom. I get obsessions related to contamination on a daily-basis and it’s exhausting being unable to touch anything outside of my house because I’m terrified to catch any viral or bacterial disease and contaminating my loved ones. I get it’s a stereotype (and by the way, maybe it’s a stereotype because so many people suffer from this compulsion) but it’s not a reason to make it look like those suffering from hand-washing compulsions are faking it. My hands burn, hurt and bleed because of it. I’m tired of it"
DangerousFee4,38,"Just need to vent a little. Rn I feel weak and lost,  I'm angry and confused. My own thoughts and doubts have turned me into a loner and every single relationship I have been in has turned bad because of my obessive tendencies.   I'm so frustrated and no one understands , witch makes complete sense cause why would someone without this disorder understand me. From the outside I look completely normal for a guy my age but on the inside I'm confused and lost.   My ocd has taken a massive toll on my relationships , I just had a look back at all my friendships and relationships. None of them lasted more then a 1yr. This disorder has absolutely destoyed my life. Even when I try to repair those relationships again they don't last.   Im just a "" odd "" "" weird"" guy that doesn't fit in with the normal crowd. I'm extremely depressed and sad how my life turned out. Also there's no fixing this, I feel hopeless and suicidal right now.   Does any one want to be my friend? Im lonely , and just an ""odd"" person."
turquoiseturtle01,5,"Today I received some bead cases in the mail that I ordered from Michaels to organize my beads in. When I opened up the cardboard box packaging, one of the plastic snap on cases broke with a large crack on it. I freaked out and was extremely disappointed. I wish that the order was more secured, especially since the cases are made from plastic and I dint know if the shippers/delivery man was being careful. Now my order feels incomplete because one of the cases cracked and the crack is really triggering me because I can’t stop thinking about it being broken and how it would’ve looked unbroken without any damages. This also triggers me because since May I have been extremely triggered by things being scratched and broken. I also dint think I can return the cracked case and I don’t know what to do with it since there’s a crack and I don’t want to get scratched by the plastic. This is so annoying and disappointing."
DangerousFee4,38,"What's the difference between denial and having gay thoughts/feelings. Rather then the mysterious onset of homosexual thoughts and feelings towards the same sex?   My anxiety is stemming from having homosexual thoughts and feelings later in life compared to other LGBT people I've talked to, who knew they where gay early on.  I know I'm over thinking this , but I can't get enough clarity to figure out what's my true sexuality behind all this brain fog."

littledaisy_07,8,I have contamination OCD. They’re bleeding and super painful but I don’t manage to wash them less at the moment. What can I use to ease the pain?
littledaisy_07,8,I just can’t function. I’m constantly anxious and my compulsions exhaust me. I feel like I don’t own my own brain anymore due to the obsessions. I’m tired. I just want OCD to leave me alone but nothing seems to work...
mavavilj,40,"It's a bit odd, because I've known for some time what I'm doing with OCD, but I fall back to it because some of the concerns seem truly ""accurate"".  I know the behaviors don't make sense, but I'm too fixated to ""beliefism"" (that behaviors are altered by beliefs) that I fall back to philosophical stances regarding ""why this belief, rather than that"".  Such as if I genuinely feel repulsed by an ugly woman, then why would I NOT display this. Even when such ugly woman would want me to believe that she is not repulsive."

BBlank223,1,"so like i see the nsfw part of twitter, mostly about people fantasizing and fetishizing male kpop idols, im already ashamed of reading and fapping to those honestly, but there was this one account where someone was talking about fantasies of their family members raping said idol. and now i feel very anxious, cause i have read incest in the past but i know i don't like it i also hate reading rape aswell, i think i have this weird thing with reading taboo, i also do think i have hyper sexuality.  i feel so ashamed of myself in general cause i enjoy these songs and groups and it makes me feel super bad about it. i feel like a creep.  tbh my mind sees something that i don't want to or know will give me intrusive thoughts and/or anxiety and then its like click on it, so i do and then skim through and back out it happens alot"
RockyK96,36,"I keep trying to take breaks and stuff but this is one habit I do compulsively I think to validation seek that people still like me and think i’m a good person. I also have alot of OCD stemming from social anxiety so I am obsessed with trying to control how other people perceive me and use my social media posting as a way to try to control that narrative. Any exposure ideas? I worked with my therapist before and it was like tweeting something that made no sense and then logging off kind of thing. I constantly tweet and delete things because think i’m being embarrassing or annoying or people could take it the wrong way. It’s really exhausting and also I feel embarrassed I have such a public compulsion so I try to weirdly make up for that by acknowledging that I tweet too much or making jokes ab tweeting and deleting or that im being crazy so it’s like better because I’m self aware somehow? Idek how can I let go of this need to control being perceived? I think about how people might talk about me or look at me when i’m not around and it makes me want to throw up, I’m constantly trying to fight the narrative I believe other people might think of me."
Elusive-Yoda,25,"1) no matter how bad your ocd may be, there is still a time where you're free from them, when you're asleep  2)ocd only exist because we focus on them, its not a defect in our brain and we still have 100% of our cognitive abilities.  3) no matter how bad an intrusive thought may be, we always end up getting used to it and it will inevitably disappear (as long as we don't try to run away from it)  4) keeping yourself busy with hobbies and such is a great way to ease the pain  5) ocd cannot kill you  6) there are many medications available out there that work great"

rioboy1985,37,"So I'm learning to stop ruminating. I learned it mostly from Michael Greenberg. However, it's not been easy. In fact, I gave in this week and ended up a mess. (My ex gf replied to some (OCD) questions I had asked her through texts and I COULDN'T accept the answers. I spent ALL day and ALL night looking at two messages. The worst thing was, I had written them. She just responded ""yes"" or ""no"". I could see the answer but my brain wouldn't accept it. I got pretty unwell because of this. Finally eating again)  Today I had the urge to check a couple of things. The urges were so strong. I started to ruminate and try to ""solve"" the problem. However, I remembered what Michael said and decided to stop ruminating. You want to know what happened? Soon after the urges died down and I had peace  The worst thing about OCD is the emotions it brings. The anxiety and fear are what make you do compulsions. But, when we stop ruminating, the emotions stick around for a while, and then eventually disappear. Soon after I had peace and forgot about my ""intrusive thoughts""   Isn't it weird how something that doesn't bother me might be your OCD fear. And then, maybe in a year I get that thought with the fear and anxiety and now I'm in your position?   The key is to stop ruminating. OCD feeds off of attention. It's the fuel for the OCD beast. Starve the beast  P.s. To stop ruminating, I learned from Greenberg, is to stop trying to solve the problem. Don't give it attention. Let it be in your awareness, but don't try to forget about it. Don't pay attention to it. Soon after as you go about your life it'll leave your awareness. It's true!"
turquoiseturtle01,5,"Does this sound like visual snow syndrome or closed eye hallucinations? Anyone here with OCD, ADHD and Autism experience visual snow syndrome and closed eye hallucinations. Ever since this August I have been seeing the outline/afterimage of things when I close my eyes from trauma of thieves stealing in my neighborhood and checking my security camera. I have been seeing detailed images from memory of my front yard, porch, backyard, and living room. This happens every time I close my eyes and I don’t know how to get rid of those images when I close my eyes. Those images keep me from sleeping and resting. My eyes have been having a hard time closing. The detailed realistic images change if I see the front porch, living room, front yard, and back yard when I close my eyes. I just want to be able to close my eyes and sleep again without seeing those images. How do I stop those closed eye hallucinations? My vision when I open and close my eyes also has floaters and static. When I start to overthink, stress, and obsess over things is especially when the images are more detailed when I close my eyes. I also get aura migraines with zigzags and feel sinus pressure and headaches on the left side of my head above my eyes. I also see cartoon characters and other images that mind starts to stress and focus on when I get stressed and overthink things and it gets me stuck."
massivesmoke,49,"ocd made me realize some things i did, it made me see them differently and i honestly understood that i am not the kind of people who are meant to have close relationships with others, because no one will want to be associated with me once they know everything. it just keeps throwing it in my face all the time, i feel unworthy of everything, i just hate who i am and wish i can just restart. ocd helped me and just destroyed my life at the same time, i feel like i dont deserve to be alive i just genuinely feel like i want to die and just hopefully someone will come every while and put a flower on my grave or just pay respect in their own way, i just hate who i am and really struggling to keep living like this, im trying but what is the worth of anything to me at this point? no worth."

Right_now78,41,why does my brain hate me so much ?
massivesmoke,49,"so i was thinking a lot about everything, and i realized some things i want to share because it is helping me. I personally have sexual themes so i think this may be too specific for my obsessions, but may work too for other themes. it has been a year since i developed pocd, did anything change? no. I just have all the evidence in the world but because of a brain-issue i have i cant seem to find a way out of this obsession. But do i really want to live like this? wasting everything and all the short time i have? do my attractions, or toughts, or even things i did before, define me really? am i really a thought? am i an attraction? no! i am not, and i have a short time here that i am wasting by obsessing. Personally i am a nihilist, i think when i die i will just not exist anymore, im sorry to say that those you love will also not exist at one point and you can do nothing about this. People think i am a negative person for having this mentality, but honestly im the only positive one. Since i realized my life has no meaning and its pointless i felt free, and knowing that after i die i will just not exist makes me happy because i know at least that suffering for me will not last forever, i just love this, i love that everything i will ever do is pointless and meaningless and in the big picture it has a very short time of worth and then its nothing, i fell free, i feel truly that nothing holds me back that i cant be tied to something. And i realized that existence is an experience that we found ourselves going through, so why make it bad? if i had like just 30 years left i want to make the most of that before i go to the infinite nothingness, because whether i spend my life sad or not it will not make a difference, so i gotta make the most of it! life is much beyond what ocd tells us, we are much beyond than what ocd tells us. Seriously, i keep realizing that my thoughts are not me, my past actions are also not me, that even if people hated me (which is a deep fear i have that ocd uses) i can at least say that i try to be moral and good so if i fuck up it doesnt define me, it is not like i get stuck in that state of being wrong...no! i evolve, i change, i fix what i messed up, i be responsible and change, whether ppl accepted me or not, i will be happy to know that i am real and try to be moral always which i would say automatically makes me moral if you think about it, so i am happy as who i am and i love that i am honest to myself and dont ignore my mistakes but do the right thing about them. I think we all should stop fucking ourselves with ocd shit, stop fucking considering every single thing to be important, it isnt. try to be ignorant a bit, it is better than just wasting your life. Being extreme in anything is wrong, so just dont make a big deal out of ANYTHING at all, because in the end we are all going to die, the whole universe will fuck up and die, and when that happens nothing will matter. so why to waste the short human experience? go fucking do things that make you happy, we arent here for long."

Alternative-Jaguar55,48,Or am I just a nut case?
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,"I just wanted to express my appreciation for this subreddit and everyone in it. None of you are alone! I'm so grateful to be able to exchange feelings and support with you all. This disorder is extremely heavy on the body mind and spirit but I am praying for us all. Each day feels like we can't continue, the thoughts, compulsions, rituals. It's so much to carry and it's unbelievably hard to try and go on but one thing I can also say is that each of us is a warrior. You are a WARRIOR. You are all so much stronger than you give yourself credit for. Only you know how you feel and how much it takes to keep pushing...but you do keep pushing... because you are freaking amazing!!! No matter how much OCD controls you, it's still YOUR life. You have a personality, you have feelings, you are not crazy, you are supported and loved...even if it is just support and love from those like you. Nobody can truly understand it unless they experience it. So that's deep, real love and support.  I'm so sorry that you have to live like this. I sympathize with you. These are the cards we were delt with but having little victories and being able to relate to those who experience your pain is a blessing in disguise. Whenever you experience that moment of defeat just remember you WILL get past it and it WILL end and during that moment, hundreds of us here are simultaneously experiencing your exact frustration. Keep your head up, you can do this! You are safe, you are not a bad person, everyone you love will be okay, you're a beautiful individual and everything will all be alright. I wish all of you healing and a beautiful breakthrough! 🙏💖"

I wasn't able to work for 5 years because of my mental health and I have only been working at this job for 3 months. It's officially too much but I can't be without a job. Does anyone have any recommendations. I know there is remote work but I get a lot of anxiety handling calls and using old equipment that's usually provided that's been used by many other people. I love animals but everything with animals includes poo. I'm lost and I need help.
Sommet_,22,I have this intrusive thought that my next door neighbor’s dog comes and pees in the washer. Would running a cycle with hot water and with tide washing machine cleaner sterilize the washer if this were true?
littledaisy_07,8,"It just feels like it’ll never get better. I don’t see how things could change. Every time I’m feeling slightly better, the relapse is 100 times worse. I’m done"
Sommet_,22,"I’ve had this intrusive thought that the next door neighbor’s dog comes and pisses on my clothes in the washer or dryer. I believe I have this because 3 months ago, the dog came over and pissed on my mother’s care tire in the driveway. Now the driveway and washer/ dryer are pretty distant from each other but I still have this thought. The thought pops up almost every time I do my laundry for the past 2 months.   A few days ago this same thought popped up feeling as though the dog came and peed on my white towels. My mother assures me that I would immediately know if there was pee on my towels by the scent. My dad also assures me that there’s no way the dog will come into the garage, open the washer/ dryer door and pee on my clothes. I do sometimes leave the washer/ dryer door for a bit to air dry.  All this reassurance and I’m still feeling this thought. So to remedy this, I grab my towels and washing them in warm water with some bleach. I then place them in the dryer then on my bed. I still feel they are dirty and when I placed them on my bed, a few towels touched my pillow, I then moved them to the side. I will spray my pillows with disinfectant spray but I feel as though through all of this, the dog pee made it’s way to my clean, fairly new pillows. I was thinking of buying a new set but don’t want to waste money. All of this just to get rid of the pee but there’s a high chance that it never happened.  Reassurance from my parents, examining my clothes and no foul odor that I smell. But those same towels I’m using anyways to dry myself just so they don’t go to waste. By “go to waste” I mean I won’t fold or place them where I usually put them but I will use them. I’ve been sleeping on my floor week after week. I plan on washing them after using them but this time with cold water. Will the dog pee effect my health? I haven’t tried ERP and I know many say it’s hell but is this good ERP? I would think touching a doorknob or not washing your hands often is good but dog piss on my pillow? on my laundry?   Summary of my last 2 month: Wake up Eat Do laundry  Sleep  I have spent some tune with family which tremendously improved my mood and OCD couldn’t touch me because my mind was else where. But that’s it. I want to sleep on my bed, I want to clean my room, I want to finally have folded clothes in my drawers after 2 months of not having them in there because I feel they are dirty and I throw them on the floor. I’ve done more laundry these past couple of months than most normal peopleOCD is shit and I know I’m asking for reassurance here but I don’t know…"
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,I can't do this anymore. I feel so scared and frustrated )':
RockyK96,36,My OCD is so tied to my social anxiety and self esteem and my brain is scanning for every embarrassing thing i’ve ever done and convincing me people see me as those things and gossip and have rumors about me. I know I cant talk myself out of it or reassure myself it’s not true but it’s so hard to try to accept that I could be some kind of pariah and extremely embarrassing person. I just keep thinking like what do people say about me when my name is brought up? I know I can’t control it but I really wish i could

rioboy1985,37,"Up until yesterday I was in a bad place for a few weeks. Very caught up in rumination and getting into a very dark place emotionally.  Then I decided just to stop ruminating yesterday. Michael Greenberg says that we don't have to accept rumination. It's not something that happens to us, it's something we DO.  WOW. Yesterday I had a number of thoughts hit me that would normally have wrecked me. I felt the fear but tried to ruminate as little as possible. Success!  I told myself to just repeat this every day. I woke up this morning and was hit with intrusive thoughts. I did ruminate this morning, but hopefully I can keep this habit up until I see some lasting change"
littledaisy_07,8,"It hasn’t happened in months. I feel super contaminated and disgusting now but at least, I did it"
BBlank223,1,"what i mean is that i notice when i feel slightly frustrated or upset, i get random harm ocd towards others or myself, its just a weird random thing that happens, i mean most of my other themes happen cause i see things online. i feel very exausted, cause like. i don't want to imagine everytime i hold a spoon, gouging out my own eyes, or everytime i walk past a car, it hitting me or running over my head.  i kinda wish i wasn't made aware of my ocd 100%, i mean i know i had symptons before, but like knowing makes it so much worse tbh."
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,Mine started after getting cdiff in the hospital after an appendectomy. I'm having a hard time finding ways to come out on top anymore.
rioboy1985,37,"For a week or so a couple months back I was feeling amazing. I wasn't having sticky thoughts, I was able to disconnect from my OCD thinking, and my mind felt strong. I had hope for the future. It was great  Then, a thought came into my mind and I got very very lost in my thoughts. I started to stay indoors and since then have felt very sad and depressed  I've realised that I filter EVERYTHING through my OCD lens (which is mostly ""legal"" OCD and which is annoying as the law is real, so it's very scary)  I need to start to stop engaging with the thoughts and get back to that place of freedom. But at the minute it's hard to lose these thoughts of doom. I'm trapped in the world of OCD and it absolutely dominates my life"
mavavilj,40,"One  of my long-term themes has been ""ugly people"" and I don't know, if it'll go away tbh. I don't know what to do to triggers that seem impossible to overcome, since they seem so natural.  Any ideas?  The only way I've figured out to cope with this is to attempt to hide my reaction to this theme, but it seems hard to undo."
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,"Hi friends, I'm have a hard time. I don't feel comfortable working at my job anymore at all. My contamination OCD is making this job very stressful and I don't know what to do. We need the money for food and necessities and to get on our feet but I constantly feel like I am being contaminated and that my stuff is getting contaminated. Especially right now. A coworker of mine has a GI infection of some sort and that is similar to what triggered my contamination OCD to start after I got cdiff from the hospital this year. The other coworkers here do not wash their hands and they touch the refrigerator, printers, drawers, papers etc. This morning I went to go pee ( I already fear going in that bathroom) and I see diareah splattered all in the toilet. I am panicking and I can't do this anymore. I have put in for other jobs today but I don't even think I want to come back tomorrow but I know it is best to put in two weeks. I don't want to feel defeated because of my OCD....but I don't feel safe here. This is the first job I've had in years because of my mental health. What should I do?"

poke000,29,"I often find myself thinking of my Mom and getting easily bothered by her-- her personality, her values, her beliefs-- they're all very different from mine.  Normally I can accept people's differences, but for some reason it is more difficult with her.   I analyze her words and always find some sort of inconsistency.  Part of it is that she is more emotional than me. That is, she forms beliefs and opinions based on how she FEELS about them.  This drives me crazy sometimes because I form beliefs and opinions based more off reason and evidence.    Another frustrating thing is the way she seems to disregard things that other people are interested in.  She doesn't judge people for it, she just doesn't have interest in it herself.  What kind of things? Pretty much everything.  I am a huge nerd and could talk for hours about my favorite shows, games, books, etc.  If I try talking to her about these things-- just to explain why they're so amazing-- she would listen, but she wouldn't get it.  It makes me feel like she doesn't respect great art and then I get irritated.  The kind of irritation you get when you try to communicate something and it just isn't getting through.  Conversation with her in general is just very unfulfilling to me.  So I started questioning if I even want a relationship with her.  Do I love her? Do I want her as a friend?  I think what I've been doing wrong though is that I am trying to make her fit into what I want from a friend.  I think I need to simply accept that she will not be my friend.  She is not someone I am going to call and have interesting conversations with.  And that's Okay.  I don't need to love her as a friend.  I just need to love her as what she is: A kind person who is my Mom.    But it's still difficult.  I'll be minding my own business and then thoughts about her will suddenly start consuming my mind.    *""Why does she think this?""*   *""How can I make her understand this?""*   *""She doesn't have good enough reasons to think this.""*  And I have to tell myself not to engage these thoughts.  But the thing that always gets me to start entertaining the thoughts is the idea that maybe I can solve it. Maybe I can finally understand her 100% and figure out a way to communicate with her perfectly! If I solve it then maybe these annoying thoughts will finally stop! So then I give in and start ruminating.    I could use some support.  I want to stop getting frustrated with her.  I want to stop having these thoughts.  I want to stop feeling like there is something to be solved.    My idea to accept that she will not be my friend-- do you think that will help? I know it sounds a bit sad, but the alternative would be to work endlessly to try to change her and fix her, and I don't want to do that anymore."

turquoiseturtle01,5,"Lately I been having too many closed eye hallucinations. When I close my eyes I still see the afterimage/outline in detail of the outside of my front yard, porch, backyard, and living room. This happens every time I close my eyes and it’s become too distracting. It’s also been causing me a hard time closing my eyes to sleep and rest because I still see those afterimage hallucinations. It’s almost as if my mind and vision have memorized those places. I just want to be able to sleep and close my eyes regularly again without seeing those images. How do I decrease those closed eye hallucinations?"
turquoiseturtle01,5,"There’s this really annoying Tik Tok sound/trend that goes “SpongeBob SpongeBob, Patrick Patrick, Sandy Sandy Sandy” that triggers my OCD. I happened to come across it a few days ago on my TikTok For You Page and it automatically triggered me. It’s just a video showing toys of Spongebob characters while someone is saying the names of the characters in a  fast spied with a pattern. The sound and video gives me a headache and migraine, also closed and open eye hallucinations because it’s too repetitive and gives me obsessive thoughts/images. Other videos using that specific sound people make on TikTok also triggers me. Whenever I scroll through the For You Page I have to scroll past those videos because it gets stuck in my head."
PeteyZee1998,24,"My OCD had several waves, just like COVID waves.  When i was 13-14, it was at an all time high, it consisted of me obsessing about my health, about heart health, as well as a fear of others dying and myself included, these obsessions took about 8 hours off my day, at 15 i had terrible POCD, it got to a point i felt like i was a monster. Suddenly around 16 it went away, i was shocked, no more OCD for me, before at around age 18 my symptoms started reappearing, and after a traumatic event, it got to a full blown crisis, i had a mental health breakdown, eventually i was prescribed medication and that helped me, up till age 21, where i had a 2nd mental breakdown so my dose was changed, i had about 3-4 sessions of counselling, i again hit remission till age 23 (my age now) before it returned pretty hardly a month ago, and a dose adjustment sorted that out. But i have learned so much about this disease, it is the harshest most strong doubting disease ever, it destroys your life. and will be with you forever, you need to get to know the monster and what he does"
rioboy1985,37,This past few months I've become like a hermit. I've mostly stayed in the house or places like Starbucks. I think I've developed a kind of social anxiety. I used to be an outgoing guy.

She also said that when you start the recovery process you'll get MORE thoughts as the brain tries to work out if you're in danger, or something like that  This past while has been rough. I live alone. I don't think the lonliness helps (I live in Rio de Janeiro but am from the UK). I am making baby steps of progress, but also having to learn more about how my brain works and learning not to even engage with the thoughts for a second. If I engage I often get trapped FOR HOURS.

Sommet_,22,For the last 7 weeks i’ve been sleeping on the floor. I probably have done more laundry in those last 7 weeks than most people do in 6 months. I’ve been consistently doing laundry nearly everyday because I feel they are dirty or bad stuff happens to it. I cant fucking live like this anymore I want to sleep on my bed. I put my first load in and the anxiety takes over. I try to push through but end up putting it off until tomorrow. Help me with this shit. Load after load. I feel paralyzed and can’t do shit. Just look at my past posts from this subreddit. I’m in hell
poke000,29,"My hands are dry and cracked from excessive washing. I apply a thick moisturizer at night to try to heal them, but it isn't enough. It's more difficult during the day because I am often eating or preparing food. I don't want to to touch food when I have moisturizer on my hands because that's how you end up ingesting things you shouldn't.   How do I know that it won't hurt me to touch food with hands covered in moisturizer? Any good reason to think it is safe?"
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,I weighed around 150 at my healthiest weight (6 months ago) I got cdiff and after getting an appendectomy the surgeon said go on a low fat diet bc my gallbladder had small amount or scar tissue but no stones. Since then I've struggled immensely with contamination ocd. I only use plastic wear to eat and can't touch my food with my hands or something else will make it feel contaminated. So not only can I only eat a low fat diet but I also can never eat because I feel like I'll get sick again if it's contaminated. This is so hard. Today I weigh a whopping 113. 😔 I'm at a low point.

PeteyZee1998,24,"I used to have this phobia before my diagnosis but with medication grew out of it. It used to just be me being preoccupied with the idea of death, or death process. But now it’s taking another form and has returned, it’s taking the form of me being very scared of men harming me or killing me, I fear I will be stabbed or bashed to death, the idea of dying naturally does not bother me anymore but via force  I live in Melbourneaussie, it’s rather safe so getting stabbed is unlikely but I still have that fear that a car will ram me, or that a person I say no to, has a knife and will kill me."

I had thoughts of him spitting in the washer or dryer where my clean clothes are so this time I was folding towels and angled myself towards the door leading out to the washer and dryer to see if he sabotaged it. I couldn’t see much since it was very early in the morning. I want to fucking wash my loads with having these thoughts But I feel like if I push through them, I will actually have pee on my clothes. Wtf am I to do? If you have time, look at my past posts on r/OCD and see the shit hole I have been in for 8 weeks. I feel like rewashing them but I’m so fucking tired of it but I also don’t want piss on my stuff  Yeah this is good ERP, having piss on my towels and clothes  Edit: I’m just gonna put those 2 fucking loads back in the dirty clothes hamper, then i’m just gonna stay in my fucking room like i have been the last few years.

Sommet_,22,"It’s early in the morning and I go out to the garage to wash some laundry. I look inside each time to see if there’s some residue inside or something. I notice that there some water drops under where the water comes out from. I feared that my neighbor’s dog peed inside of it. I have this fear because months ago, the dog peed on my mother’s tire in the driveway. Now the driveway and washer are like 12+ away from each other but I have this fear. I wipe whatever it was in the washer with a napkin and smell it. Smells like nothing. It’s clear but not yellow. After all of this, I still feel as though the dog peed inside. I washed 2 blankets right now to sorta “clean” the washer and I plan to officially start my own clothes.   What should I do? I’ve been sleeping on my floor for 7 weeks and washed so many loads already I want this shit to end please. Do i tough it out and accept the pee on my clothes? Or is there no pee at all and I’m overreacting? I posted a photo of what I saw on r/germaphobe"

DangerousFee4,38,"All the psych medications made my dick numb and emotional numbed out. Ive become a alcoholic over the years to deal with my over whelming disorder.   I want to end my life so bad , but alcohol is cheap and I guess I'll just drink and make every one elses life around me misserable.   Btw, mental health care system is absolute garbage. I've been thrown around as a experimental rat. They put me on so many mind altering meds that ended up destroying my body and brain.   This place is fuckin pathetic and doctors don't have your best interest. I've meet with over 20 different doctors , they have no clue what their talking about.   I'm stuck and don't like this feeling of hopelessness. Shame on my loved one who knew what she was doing."
DangerousFee4,38,Do you guys think I did the right thing? This girl was into me for awhile. I never told her I was having ocd and anxiety thoughts about my sexuality. I ended up dated her for a couple month before the doubting and questioning became overwhelming to the point the relationship wasn't even enjoyable.   I was having gay thoughts and feelings about other men while being in the relationship. My question is how do people even have a relationship while having this obsessive disorder?  I'm suicidal and having this disorder is bringing me to become lonely and isolated.   How don't I know what my sexuality is?

I’m also exhausted from having to do so many compulsions and it’s a heavy mental illness to carry all day.

I still keep having closed eye hallucinations and don’t  know how they can go away. When I close my eyes I see images still of the outside of my front yard, front porch, and backyard.

turquoiseturtle01,5,"I noticed that when I go online & see stock photos of things being sold, it triggers my OCD. There will be times where I see stock photos of what’s available, it stays in my mind. Like if there’s something I really wanna a buy my mind memorizes it & I can’t stop thinking about it. This also happens too when certain things go out of stock that my mind won’t stop thinking because it sees it as being incomplete. A lot of the stock photos can also be too repetitive to the point where I get migraines and headaches from thinking about it. I am starting to try to avoid ordering online as a break to rest my mind and thoughts. I especially try to avoid websites like EBay, Depop, Etsy, Poshmark, and etc because those are the most triggering with bad experiences I’ve had in the past from those sites."
turquoiseturtle01,5,Lately it’s been hard for me trying to not order from online. I’ve slowly been getting back into my hobby of making beaded bracelets that I haven’t done in a few years. Not too long ago I made the mistake of giving away a lot of my beads while I was reorganized my room. A few years later I regret that mistake still because I still miss those beads and know those certain ones can’t be found anymore. My mind is trying to remember which beaded bracelets I made and it’s like it’s researching which exact patterns I did with certain colors and sizes.   A few weeks ago I have started ordering beads from a website and I’ve been struggling with constantly ordering beads. Once the beads have been delivered I organize them in cases and bins but then my mind tells me I’m missing certain colors in order for there to be more of a variety. I keep going onto that bead website to add certain beads to a wishlist and have notifications set when certain beads restock. It’s frustrating when there’s beads I plan to order end up selling out/discontinuing. My mind turn starts to constantly think that I still need those certain beads as once it feels incomplete and it ends up disappointing that they’ll never be sold again.   After I’ve ordered certain beads sometimes when they get delivered the beads spill out of the bag when I open the packaging and it’s so frustrating because I wish they were more secured and packaged from the warehouse and shipping. My mind then gets images of certain beads I need for bracelets  and it’s hard to get those images out of my mind because it tries to memorize what it looks like from the stock photos from the bead website. I also sometimes have those thoughts and images in my mind in my sleep and it’s hard for me to get those out of my dreams. I even get sinus headaches and migraines when I overthink about them.
rioboy1985,37,"OCD can take things you've been completely comfortable with and all of a sudden make you doubt them. It comes with such fear and uncertainty it terrifies you into trying to solve them. The WORST thing you can do is start to try to solve the problem. You feed the OCD cycle, EVEN if you get temporary peace. Remember, as soon as you give in you'll get sucked in and go on a wild goose chase after that ""right feeling""  As Jeffrey Schwartz says, ""it it feels like OCD, it is OCD"". This truth has saved me various times. I've been able to stop ruminating, and when the emotions calm and my mind settles, I can see it was in fact OCD. OCD is a liar, and if you see this you can learn not even to pay attention (it isn't always easy!)   As you start on the journey to recovery the thoughts seem to hit you harder. However, the above truth has helped me differentiate between ""OCD thinking"" and real thoughts  The fear and other emotions can be so strong at times that we feel we must give in. NO! If we stay strong it will eventually fade and we will find peace and victory (but we must stop ruminating 100%. Don't even do sneaky ruminating.)   As you continue to refuse to give in to OCD, doing compulsions, your mind gets stronger. There are people that have made a full recovery! Keep going and don't give up"

poke000,29,I made a post about it here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/qq5nme/i_need_support_with_my_food_safety_ocd/hjyo6fq/?context=3  Then the person went to my profile and commented on that thread. I know I could block this person but I really want to understand why she is behaving this way. I need to understand where she is coming from but all I'm getting is yelling in all caps.   What should my response be?
littledaisy_07,8,It’s so debilitating. It just keeps repeating on loop over and over again and doesn’t want to go away. What can I do? Any kind word would be appreciated :(
poke000,29,"I keep throwing out food and I never know if it's for a good enough reason or not.    Sometimes I will post questions about it on Reddit, asking if such and such is safe, and sometimes the answers sound the same as the OCD.  For example, I often throw out cans of food for one reason or another. I've been using a lot of canned pumpkin. Many of them have a small brown spot at the top. The most upvoted answer says this is normal. But one person, who saw that I had multiple posts about food safety, actually got mad at me and said in all caps that it was MOLD. This person then tries to tell me that the reason I am posting more than once is because I just don't like the answer that it is mold.   This really bothered me. For one thing, the brown spot being mold was not the consensus. Quite the opposite. She also got me all wrong. She doesn't get that I can easily accept the answer that there's something wrong with the food. That's the problem.   How can I stop throwing things out when both my brain and angry people on the internet are telling me I should throw it out?"

mavavilj,40,"Suggestion: Please take all effort in order to minimize OCD, you will be grateful afterwards. It truly ruins lives, but you may not realize this before it's quite late already.  I've not considered OCD as much of a problem that it actually is due to beng manipulated by the condition (since it alters memory, motivation, goal setting etc.). But after getting better:  * I realize that I have possibly wasted 70-80% of time that I could have used otherwise, to OCD.  E.g.  * Reading lecture notes and papers for maybe 6x the time compared to in which they could be completed in given proper planning and focused reading. E.g. compare how long you take to understand one page of text, when the ideal should be around 1 minute per page. * Repeating things that could be completed in 1/5-1/6th the time with proper focus and organization.  What could this have been used for:  * for graduating from uni faster * for advancing career prospects * for advancing relationships  But what I rather did:  * ponder detailedly different sorts of problems that **seemed very meaningful** and fulfilling even"
rioboy1985,37,When your mind is clear you need to be ready to pay no attention to the thoughts. It's when you feel free that your mind tests you
BBlank223,1,"So like, you know those ""satisfying"" videos of people running things over with their cars? Yeah I'm having thoughts about it being my head infront of the tires, also had a thought of pushing someone infront of a car.  The usual random stabbing myself or someone else in middle of night are annoying.  I feel like before I knew about having ocd(I mean looking back before I realized, I think I had suspected it) it wasn't as bad as it is now."
massivesmoke,49,"ok so in one weird moment 2 years ago i was angry, it caused an arousal, and then a weird bad thought popped into my head about harming the person making me angry. Back then i didnt have the ocd theme that causes such things, i just was like ""ugh no! why did i even have this thought?!"" and just ignored it (guess its called the ol' good days!) i didnt get stuck in it, i think it repeated once or twice and thats all, tho would say i was 16 or something back thing so my hormones were always active, and the fact that the whole thing reminded me of sex caused the reaction to be even bigger, tho i didnt go along with the thought and remember considering it really really bad (and thinking about it repeating and not being something i like but something i hate, safe to say my mind played a trick on me). So is this considred an intrusive thought? is it like my mind throwing something random and all? or did my mind just crash because of the different kinds of feelings that were mixed together weirdly (anger, which caused an arousal, and the thought that reminded me of sex)"
massivesmoke,49,"i posted about this earlier today, here is the post:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/qp7w41/seriously\_help\_me\_why\_do\_i\_get\_aroused\_when\_im/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/qp7w41/seriously_help_me_why_do_i_get_aroused_when_im/)  &#x200B;  please answer directly, yes or no, for heavens sake"

massivesmoke,49,"so i posted this in nother sub and the comments caused me to question everything. i noticed this happens a lot, when im angry or frustrated about anything i get an arousal (tho it isnt directed to the cause) like my dog is just being annoying, it might cause me to get angry enough to get an arousal tho the arousal is not directed to my dog its more like when you feel horny but there is nothing sexual or romantic, its more confusing if you ask me. When my mom and i fight, or when anyone is just being annoying but again it isnt directed to the cause, but to no one. I researched on that and found that seemingly when we are angry a lot of hormones are released that are similar to those during sex or something, and the body seeks relief by sex or something like that. I also found that sometimes it happens to people and someone said that the chemical reactions of anger and being horny are kinda not so different from each other and how like anger means more testosterone and testosterone is like matters to be horny and all. Tho the problem is: some people have sex with their partners after arguments and fights, and that is what my ocd is preying on...3 ocd themes triggered at once and im feeling very very very anxious it would be great if someone gives some help about why does this ahppen"
Master-Champion-1528,42,"As many of you know, because the mods probably hate me for posting so much about the topic, I have POCD. For the past few days I’ve been trying to limit my compulsions and let the thoughts be there. But I’ve also found myself saying phrases like “they’re just thoughts, let them be”, “it’s just the groinal response, it doesn’t mean anything” and “don’t test yourself you’ll never get an answer that will be certain to the OCD” . I know a compulsion can be anything to help calm your anxiety, so do you guys think that this a compulsion I've developed? Or is this a good way to just let the thoughts go slowly and can actually help in the long run."
massivesmoke,49,"i would say the past 12 days were much better than the episode i had before em, im getting ebtter, im learning everyday how to ignore ocd more, tho sometimes i slip and not ignore it. Im kinda labeling any thought i hate ocd. even when its not ocd lmao, cuz why not? for now, i have a lot guilt and i think im unworthy of everything because of some past stuff, and because of my thoughts, i think i need to try working on this guilt and see why my fears are like that. Tho i honestly question how easy to find a real friend is after all that, i dont think anyone will truly want to be near me, but oh well...its sad but i guess this is just my life and i gotta deal with it, i dont think its the worst i went through, i mean i lived 2 days thinking im a pedophile (pedo ocd) and still found a way to just continue living through them, this should be easier i guess, i hope so at least. i want to start over as a better person, i want to live normally like everyone else, i am not a bad person and i dont think i deserve the guilt that i feel, in the end im just 18 i literally just entered a whole new phase in life! This will sound weird but i need your prayers, even if u dont believe in any god just pray that whatever the fuck is out there to help me cuz i truly need that lol. Best wishes for everyone"
littledaisy_07,8,"So, yes. A so-called ""educating"" account said you couldn’t have OCD with hand-washing compulsions because it’s nothing else than a stereotype. It really upsets me as I struggle on a daily-basis with severe contamination OCD and hand-washing compulsions. And I know I’m not the only one as it’s one of the most common compulsions among people who suffer from contamination OCD.  It’s exhausting not being able to directly touch anything and constantly having raw skin due to excessive washing. Honestly it saddens me so much"
poke000,29,"I live on a top floor of an apartment, and since it's an old building, the unit directly below can hear everything.  Every footstep.  The housing office said they got a noise complaint a few months ago, and ever since then, I've been very careful about making noise.  Too careful, to the point where it's hard to relax.  I am up early, during quiet hours, and often find myself literally walking on my toes.  Literally.  Because I don't want to disturb anyone.    # An Unwelcome Visitor  The other day I was listening to an audiobook while doing dishes.  Normally I would wear headphones, but I get tired of having them in all the time.  During quiet hours I must use headphones,  and at the current time it's outside quiet hours, so I felt it would be OK to listen on my speakers.  It was turned up just enough so I could make out the words over the running water.  Suddenly, I hear a BANG BANG BANG like the sound of a cannon.  I compare it to the sound of a cannon because it was LOUD.  I jumped and instantly felt the flood of addrenalin caused by the sudden booming.  I soon realized it was coming from my door.  I stopped the audiobook and looked through the peephole to find a man.  We'll call him John-- the tenant who lives in the unit below me.  He looked furious. He then talked to me through the door:  *""Turn that f\*\*\*ing thing off right f\*\*\*ing now.  I mean it.  I am tired of you constantly stomping around.  If you don't cut it out I'm going to come up here and bash your f\*\*\*ing head in.""*  I was too shaken to respond, and he turned around and left.    # The Aftermath  I immediately called the housing office to report it, and then I called the police to file a report.  The police showed up at my unit a few minutes later, and had me explain it again.  The officer was very sympathetic and said he's lived in an apartment before and knows that every footstep can be heard below.    He went down to have a chat with John, who denied coming up to talk to me, but did grumble about the noise.  The officer knew he was lying but couldn't do much since I had no evidence and my description of the man was vague (I haven't seen him enough and I was too shaken to remember what he was wearing). The officer was clever though and said to John, *""If you happen to hear of anyone banging on someone's door and making threats, be sure to remind them that this is illegal and can result in an arrest.""*  The officer came back to me and recounted his conversation with John.  It is a little comforting to know that John has now probably been scared into never doing that again.  The housing office also said they would address it with him, though could not give me any details.    # My Thoughts  It was likely an empty threat.  I don't know the man well.  And I don't think he even knows what I look like, which is comforting.  I do know the neighborhood well, and it is a very safe neighborhood.  Lots of families and retired people.  Crime rates are very low.  I do not want to bend to his threat in any way.  I should be able to listen to something on my speakers during non-quiet hours without being afraid of someone trying to hurt me.  But part of me wonders if I should actually just move out.  I hate to do that since I love where I live now (except for my downstairs neighbor).  Any other place would be not be in as good of a location, and would not fit my needs the way my current place does.  Right now I am home.    I can't fathom how someone would be so unreasonable.  He bangs on my door as hard as he can, and makes demands and threats due to my normal living noises.  The irony here is that out of every sound that has ever come from my unit, the loudest by far was the banging on my door.  The noise HE made!  # The Question  It's been about a week, but I can't stop ruminating on it, especially when I make a noise that may be heard below (which is pretty much every footstep).  Should I just move out? Or should I accept that this happened, but I am not in any real danger?"
poke000,29,"I wash my hands a lot, especially before eating.  I am very careful because anything I touch can easily end up ingested (especially if eating finger food).     As an example, when grabbing things from cupboards I sometimes think I may have accidentally touched the metal hinges, and sometimes hardware like this has nasty stuff on them that you aren't meant to ingest.  I've touched things like that before and a small amount of black grease (or something) came off of it.  So if I think I may have touched a metal hinge, I will wash my hands.  Same with the hardware you'll find on doors.  If I think I accidentally touched it while walking past a doorway, I will wash my hands.    Basically my rule is-- if I wouldn't eat directly off something, I should not touch it before eating unless I wash my hands afterwards.    I know this is OCD. It must be.  But I continue to do it because, based on what I know, it is a rational safety precaution.  I need a smart, science-minded person to explain why this type of thinking is irrational."
littledaisy_07,8,"I came to that conclusion today. I have severe contamination OCD with hand-washing compulsions (I know it sounds stereotypical and I’m sorry but I truly suffer from it. It’s debilitating on a daily basis). I wore gloves all day because it was freezing and they reduced my obsessions/intrusive thoughts and my hand-washing compulsions. It felt less heavy than usual but truly saddened me as I realise that it’s the only almost normal day I’ve had in nearly one year as far as my hands are concerned. I’m afraid it becomes how I have to live on a daily basis (with gloves on my hands). I miss the life I had before and the lack of constant worry in it. By the way, I’m aware that wearing gloves isn’t the solution to my problem but they made a change today. I’m tired of fighting against something that’s obviously stronger than I am."

rioboy1985,37,"I think stopping ruminating is like training a muscle. At the start it's difficult, but then it gets easier. I'm learning just not to do it. It's SO SCARY not to ruminate. It's like, ""if I don't ruminate then maybe something bad will happen."" We know that ruminating doesn't get us anywhere. But we don't stop  I didn't say ""can't"" as I've been studying every day the articles of Dr Michael Greenberg and he says everyone ""can"" stop, as it's actually a compulsion. I'll post some below, but I'm starting to get the hang of not ruminating. Dr Greenberg's method is actually incredibly simple, yet effective. I'm learning to just stop ruminating. When I start to get the hang of it it's weird. Hope reenters my life, freedom and peace. But I get scared as it's like, ""oh no, I feel like something should be wrong. I need to worry about something.""  This shows me that I have a long way to go in training my mind that it's OK to be at peace. But it also is good, as I'm learning that it's all in my head, and that my OCD is biochemical.  You should try to stop ruminating too. Honestly, I'm failing so much, but I'm like a baby learning to walk. I'm slowly making progress and being able to get on with my day.   The best thing about Dr Greenberg is he himself has recovered from OCD    https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/understanding-pure-o-you-are-not-having-intrusive-thoughts-all-day-you-are-ruminating/  https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/defining-rumination/  https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/how-to-stop-ruminating/  https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/articles/"

Right_now78,41," for example when i am euphoric or happy, the ocd paranoid turns to pronoid ( instead of thinking someone is gonna hurt, i think that they are secretly want to surprise me) the thoughts patterns are literally the same and goes the same way, for example when i am anxious i will make a  whole scenario about how my house gonna burn if i don't check the charger but when i am happy i make a whole scenario of how succesful i am gonna be if i read that sentence in that article 3 more times... that just an example of manyyyyyyyy, OCD is in my opinion the most complicated disorder"
littledaisy_07,8,"I don’t understand. I feel like anxiety is at the core of OCD and plays a HUGE role in everything we experience. It all revolves around it (at least in my experience). My intrusive thoughts make me anxious, I NEED to respond and do a compulsion (otherwise I’m too anxious but I know it’s not the way I should be doing it. I’m doing my best to resist). I get a temporary relief, then the anxiety comes back, so do the intrusive thoughts and so on. So, why have I heard once or twice that OCD wasn’t an anxiety disorder?"

massivesmoke,49,"Note: this might trigger some ppl   i have been whooping ocd lately, 7 days of not listening to ocd but the trauma doesnt go when you stop obsessing. I dont know what should i even say, all i know is that there was no one to help me, it was so dark...so lonely, i was crying desperately i would try to smoke then throw the cigarette away then light another one and throw it too, i sat there like ""i have a knife, i can fix this, i just need to not panic when i cut my wrists"" but i didnt cut them, i dont know why i am so scared of actually doing it all the time. Where should i go? what should i go? who would listen? who would believe me? will anyone ever love me? i remember i needed someone, i always have been terrified of cancer or blindness or any thing like this, i remember then i begged anything that can cause me this, to do them, but make what i believed back then false, safe to saysince then i dont cling to life. I went through an alcohol abuse phase, for someone who barely used to drink i would finish half a liter of vodka in like 2 days (that would be like, 30-35 shots) i would be drunk all the time, my friend once asked me what do i feel when i drink and all i could think of is ""there is no ocd when im drunk"". I honestly feel all the time that i want to die, if i get cancer i would probably leave the hospital dancing and live my last days on pain killers because i dont want to stay alive and try to get cancer therapy. I fel im slipping back into alcoholism, the thought of getting alcohol and drinking till i sleep happily for the rest of the day seems brighter than what i live with, im kinda trying to live with the idea that i will not have any friends (or say real friends) or have any kind of romance that i will take seriously and not just for fun,but im tired, u know? everytime i remember what happened at that night, i just dont feel like i want to stay like this. I lived 2 days thinking im apedophile, and that night was the night i believed my ocd and couldnt prove it wrong (later tho i was able to), all the people that i loved got creeped out even tho im the same person who always rejected child abuse, and sometimes im too extreme that i think my idea of protecting children is itself harmful to them because it limits the child lol. No one told me that itwill be ok, no one said that i should get therapy. They just were ready to leave. My best friend left me a while later because her stupid boyfriend doesnt like me, its like thousands of stabs right in my heart. We actually made up after that and i remeber once i was drunk and kinda attacked her verbally saying things like ""you meant the world to me, you were everything to me"" and i think about that night and remember how i was feeling, when i get drunk all the barriers disappear if i think u suck i will tell u u suck and might punch u to express it lol, to go to her and tell her all that, and when she talks i would tell her to shut up probably lmao, funny but sad tbh. I thought i got over it, but i dont think i will ever do, she was the only person in the world who i would consider as someone who will never leave me, but she did. Since then i dont really see any relationship as important or lasting, i dont believe in friendship or LoVe, they are not real to me and i wouldnt risk myself to test if they are. I feel lonely, if i done some wrong things before i wold love to get help, if i am doing wrong things i would love to get help, if i was born with something bad but i dont go with it then i am not inherently bad and evil when i didnt choose anything. I genuinely think that the only actual friends i will have are either people with ocd and same experiences as i am, or pedophiles (non offender of course). And it is hard to live like this, and i am tired of living like this, i want to end all this."

Scared in the sense of ""oh no, I should be worrying about something. If I don't worry then something bad might happen."" I think this is the lie of OCD and what we need to get over.

Sommet_,22,"Yesterday I was able to wash some of my laundry today, I resisted most of the compulsions and followed through. Everything went well until I came out of the bathroom from a shower. I hear a relative calling me for the plunger, I assume they need to unclog the other bathroom toilet. They then go into the kitchen with it and I start getting anxiety, I remember another relative of mine used the plunger to unclog the dishwasher (they used a plastic bag wrap the plunger), I hear what they are saying and doing. I am 99% sure they were using that plunger to unclog the kitchen sink. As all of this is going one, I stand in my room with a towel on hearing them. I wanted to avoid going out there so I wouldn't have to help.  Side Note: Another reason why I hate OCD in general is my selfish behaviors like this  I wash my hands in that sink 95% of the time and I need to figure out how to clean the shit out of it. My anxiety started growing and usually when that happens, I get angry and I want to release that anger. But I just calmed myself down and was trying to change my way of thinking as in, instead of my worrying about cleaning the sink, worry if your relative needs help. With someone who has COCD, you know probably know how I'm feeling. Right now I'm in my room and will be going to sleep soon. My relative is telling the whole household to not use the kitchen sink and hold off until tomorrow when they will take a look at it. I will then help them since I would have started my day. What would you guys do when it comes to cleaning this? Maybe posting this in [r/Adulting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/) would help but I'm posting this from the perspective with someone who has COCD, me."

pleaseimconfused,21,i’m 18f diagnosed with ocd. edit for the title: i mean while you’re doing the testing or checking compulsion you’ll be told you want the negative thoughts or to do something bad but while you’re testing yourself you realize you don’t.  sometimes i’ll tell myself that “NO i don’t have these thoughts and i don’t want to do the compulsion” but then my brain will tell me the opposite and i’ll do a compulsion and while i’m doing it i panic and think about how i don’t want to do it.. is this normal? and i’m relieved whenever i don’t do that thing or i realize i didn’t hurt anyone or anything. is this still ocd?
rioboy1985,37,"My dream is to be a dad. I'm gonna be 36 next month and I really thought that I would be there by now. But.. OCD....  It seems like a fantasy, for me to have a normal life. It's as if it's for other people, but not for me. The crazy thing is that what other people take for granted, we OCDers see as a dream, a wish. This could be the ability to get a full night's sleep and wake up in peace and with hope. It could be to be able to shake hands with someone without being terrified of what's on your hands. I could go on  When OCD hits it can make you feel incredibly lonely. You feel like this darkness has come upon you and all peace and stability goes out the window. It can break the strongest man into pieces. It imprisons you in a room without daylight.   The good thing is that thanks to the testimony of others this can be my reality. I've seen others break free and I can too. I think one of the things we need is hope. Hope keeps us going in recovery like, ""come on son, just keep going, just keep resisting these compulsions"". As we do our brains change their wiring and we step into a new reality. This is my hope. I wanna be that dad with my wife and kids. I wanna be able to have people say things that would have wrecked me before and be able to say, ""haha whatever. I'm free now"""
littledaisy_07,8,I touched an egg shell and I can’t help but obsess over the fact that I may develop salmonella. I’m so scared despite washing my hands 4 times and showering. I feel like it’s too late  What should I do please?
Sommet_,22," Yesterday I was able to wash some of my laundry today, I resisted most of the compulsions and followed through. Everything went well until I came out of the bathroom from a shower. I hear a relative calling me for the plunger, I assume they need to unclog the other bathroom toilet. They then go into the kitchen with it and I start getting anxiety, I remember another relative of mine used the plunger to unclog the dishwasher (they used a plastic bag wrap the plunger), I hear what they are saying and doing. I am 99% sure they were using that plunger to unclog the kitchen sink. As all of this is going one, I stand in my room with a towel on hearing them. I wanted to avoid going out there so I wouldn't have to help.  Side Note: Another reason why I hate OCD in general is my selfish behaviors like this   I wash my hands in that sink 95% of the time and I need to figure out how to clean the shit out of it. My anxiety started growing and usually when that happens, I get angry and I want to release that anger. But I just calmed myself down and was trying to change my way of thinking as in, instead of my worrying about cleaning the sink, worry if your relative needs help. With someone who has COCD, you know probably know how I'm feeling. Right now I'm in my room and will be going to sleep soon. My relative is telling the whole household to not use the kitchen sink and hold off until tomorrow when they will take a look at it. I will then help them since I would have started my day. What would you guys do when it comes to cleaning this? Maybe posting this in r/Adulting would help but I'm posting this from the perspective with someone who has COCD, me."
massivesmoke,49,"this is an update for a previous post. Well, 4 days of trying, im getting better at it! im learning that not every thought that comes to me matters or reflects deep issues or beliefs, not to mention the ability to know what thought is ocd-ish, and what thought is coming truly from me. I am getting better, i would say i reduced the time of obsessing from 90% to like 60% or even 50% or less. I am gaining power over ocd, and living easily and happily, and with less anixety. Its good! i think i will start some mindfulness routine to get even better, and i am using some herbs sometimes to stay chill throughout the day. I dropped coffee, not the best thing to drink tbh, and i noticed that getting good sleep and not staying up until 2 am or having a messy sleep schedule is very important, like sleep at 10 pm and wake up at 8 am or something, that helped me a lot. Also, i am trying to not give myself too much emptiness and space and time to overthink everything, like truly being busy is a bless, so to keep myself occupied is important and i have a long list of things to do so im happy about it, im much more better than the last week when i had covid and couldnt do shit besides watching youtube, i had all the time in the world to obsess and its not healthy. I am making progress, a bit slow but still great! i might as well start even more new things and add them to my to do list daily. if anything, i think we all should learn to ignore ocd. Believe that you are a good person deep down, dont fuck yourself up for one thought or one mistake, we are all humans and we cant ever not make mistakes. Life seems much more better! i hope everyone gets better too, if u have a tip, share it plz!"
carter_pride,46,"I didn't even know what it was but I would resist reading certain topics, resist reading certain books, or try to avoid cross-contamination of thoughts.  Utter madness.  This constant dread and disgust and these invisible walls - someone should have told me as a child that I was so messed up.  Well, I'm still messed up, but at least I now know that it's a real condition.  Utter madness.  We're living in the dark ages of mental health.  They should teach psychology and self-regulation to everyone.  We've gatekeep knowledge, we gatekeep freedom, we gatekeep happiness - we gatekeep everything.  Our species are natural enslavers.

BBlank223,1,"so like i have a masturbation compulsion, and it fucking sucks, cause im not really even aroused before but anyway, i did just that, but i got into hentai pictures of a game i played again, i don't even want to do that cause i know i don't like seeing the characters in that way at all or don't want to, when i started playing the game i did't but then i had a search compulsion to read fanfic smut/and look at hentai.   when reading the smut it also got into taboo/dark stuff, which i don't want. but apparently my mind thinks i need to read. i mean i also saw a gore fanart of one of the characters acouple of days ago, i mean i saw it on twitter so it was cropped in a way that didn't show the gore at all but my mind was like, ""Click on it"" i did(wasn't masturbating at all to this pic)   it makes me not wanna play the game cause like, i never wanted to see any of the characters sexually. and i don't but intrusive thoughts keep happening.  also another thing i hated was while i was masturbating at 1 am, i was doing it to all sorts of fanfiction, it went into more taboo/dark things. my brother decided to bring a loud phone out to the kitchen where i couldn't block out the noise. then started the intrusive thoughts about him and his friend.  while i was reading a story about stepfather/stepson smut. yea i don't know if it is a weird ocd obsession but like fuck this."
littledaisy_07,8,"I noticed that whenever my periods are coming/I’m on my periods, my intrusive thoughts and obsessions become out of hands. I also have a much harder time resisting my compulsions and am overall feeling extremely sad and anxious. Does anyone else have this? Should I bring it up in therapy?"
NameIntrepid,9,I’ve gotten so used to the ruminating that my normal way of thinking is just gone. I feel like a vegetable all the time.
pleaseimconfused,21,"hello, i’m 18f and am diagnosed with ocd. it is so severe now and nothing seems to be helping, i’m on antipsychotics because i was starting to have delusions and paranoia but it still won’t go away. i had to drop out and come back home because i can’t function properly snd i don’t like to leave my house   yesterday i had to fly back home on an airplane. i was on first class so more legroom. there was a child seated in front of me which made me anxiety spike and i was so careful tje whole trip to be careful but then i got an intrusive thought and a compulsion. i wasn’t sure where my legs were and i was telling my brain to not curl my toes out of fear it would touch him but it happened anyways, it was so scary it’s like i had no control even though i was telling myself dont do it i got this random voice in my head that went “proceeds to do it anyways” and then i spent tje entire rest of the flight worrying and doing checking compulsions. it’s been over 24 hours and i can’t let this go. what i do remember is looking down after and seeing that there was a good amount of space between my shoe and my backpack which was under the seat, that i could see my whole backpack and that the person next to me had their legs all the way under the seat and i was in a very different position from them   i’m so scared that i molested this kid i don’t want to cause someone pain or trauma.  edit: i’m scared to live with the uncertainty even though i’m 90 percent sure my foot wasn’t even under the seat. i hate being alive. i’m scared i’m a horrible person. i’ve been looking up tje models of tje plane and trying to recreate the scenario all day because i want to make sure i didnt actually cause any damage"
littledaisy_07,8,I was scared I wasn’t going to function but I managed it and I’m freaking happy
DangerousFee4,38,"Is this ocd or sexuality. There's no answers, since ocd is a identity disorder and makes me question my values and identity. But also there's people who are truly in the LGBTQ community.   What community should I reach out to? I'm so confused about my sexuality.   I've done some complusions in the past but know I'm convinced these thoughts and feelings are mine.   So what do I do? Accept my new sexuality identity? Idk what to do anymore. Why does this happen to people?   Some one help"
littledaisy_07,8,I can’t function without meds. Compulsions can easily be much more powerful than I can handle and the thoughts won’t leave me alone. I don’t see how I could hope for a life without OCD in it. It feels impossible.

I’ve been sleeping on the ground for 5 weeks straight now, I turned a total of 6 loads of laundry into almost 30. I can’t take this shit anymore, the concrete ground topped with carpet probably feels better than my newly bought bed. Every fucking time a do a load of laundry I feel it’s not clean. We have flies everywhere which makes it more irritating and these thoughts make me want to fucking shoot myself. No job, no car, no gf, no life. I sometimes starve myself because I can’t leave my room. I’m thinking of giving my bed away at this rate I can’t fucking take it fuck me man.  Wake up Clean Anxiety Repeat"
littledaisy_07,8,I just need some tips or nice words please. I feel like I absolutely need to wash my hands 4 times in a row. I’m supposed to wash my hands 12 times/day for therapy but I’ve already reached 20 and the day isn’t over at all...please what should I do? Nothing helps and I struggle to resist the urges
massivesmoke,49,"UMMM so i have this new theme of ocd where i am afraid i like the nazis, or lowkey dont respect jews. So i was talking with a friend about jewish animal sacrifice thingy, and what sparked that is seeing one horrible photo of nazis executing innocent jews. The photo had one big impact on me, but reminded me of the animal sacrifice. Like they took jews like sheep and killed them with cold blood. I dont see there is a difference between the value of animal life or human life, and dont think its ok to kill an animal for any reason even food (but im not jewish so it doesnt matter,i dont have to do sacrifices) and i should state that i hate the nazis, and i even have jewish friends. So i dont like hate jews or something. But i think maybe seeing jews, humans, being treated badly and killed like that could be like a reason for us humans in general to not treat animals badly, coming from the point that we may not truly feel compassion towards animals because we see them as lesser than us, but when we see people like us go through something so horrible we may change what we see and feel compassion and like change you know? like there are some jews who see that animal sacrifices should never be a thing again and all that, and i agree with it. Like i feel this is very disrespecting to jews, but i dont mean anything bad, and its not like i can do anyything about how nazis did all that shit. I just had this thought, that maybe if you think you have the right to kill an animal for any reason, realizing that jews were treated the same way as animals by nazis could make you feel more compassion towards animals and not be so curel to them or see them as lesser beings with no rights. This is how i changed my view of animals, i saw a conspiracy theory that some people breed humans to then slaughter them and sell their meat to the elites. Since the i started seeing humans and animals as equals, and that i felt bad for animals like imagine ebing born just to be slaughtered? how bad that is. So the whoole thing wet down like ""you know how jews were treated by nazis? how they killed them and all that? that is exactly what animals go through"" and i should stress that i am not saying that animals and jews areequal i am saying that animals and all humans are equal, and animals have the right to live as much as we do. I am sorry if this was wrong, and if it is wrong please correct me and tell me where did i go wrong so ican fix my mistake."
Sommet_,22,"I will be having my appointment with an OCD therapist son and I want to ask for advice. Would it be wise to tell them my intrusive thoughts You know, the thoughts that are erotic, violent and such. I've read some posts about therapy helping a lot but some others said it didn't I'm very secretive with my thoughts, intentions, ambitions, etc and I want to open up to help others help me but I don't want it to back fire."
NameIntrepid,9,"I hate it sooo muchh, making me doubt myself and everything I do. It’s like this overwhelming feeling of guilt and doubt when I shouldn’t be feeling that way."
rioboy1985,37,"Ok, well maybe not literally EVERYTHING, or I wouldn't be able to type this, but in the general sense. For example, in the morning an intrusive thought comes, then you spend a couple of hours trying to deal with it. Then when you leave you have to make sure the electrical appliances are all off, and the water taps, a number of times. Then when you go out you have one finger on one hand (for me the right hand) that you use to open doors, and put in your pin code for your card (I'm British).   Then you go to a cafe and have to check the chair for syringes/blood etc to make sure you're not gonna get Hepatitis B/C (you know it's B/C because you've spent hours researching Hepatitis 😊). Then you have to disinfect the Starbucks table because.... Germs. Then you put alcohol on your hands and remember you didn't disinfect your Starbucks cup so you have to spray it with alcohol then your hands. When you leave you remember to use your ""dirty finger"" to open the door.   Then you go out with your friend and get a thought that maybe you commited a crime 20 years ago, so you have to check your memory to analyse the situation and you zone out and end up getting confused and inventing stuff that didn't happen.  When that problem is resolved and you find out you're not a criminal you are ecstatic. But it doesn't last long. Some homeless guy has touched you to get your attention and now you have HIV. You're a social outcast. You spend an hour looking for an open sore on your body and traces of blood.  After finally accepting that nothing can be found you're again chilled, until you start to read your book and have to reread the same sentence over and over because maybe it will have dire consequences for your life.  Welcome to my life  😊😭 My brain is constantly turned on and super hyper attentive. It's exhausting. After reading and studying Dr Michael Greenberg I'm learning how to stop paying attention to the thoughts. But now I'm becoming so aware of how much of an OCD pit I'm trapped in. I hope to follow his advice and soon be out of this hell"
massivesmoke,49,"well, i yesterday made a decision to not care about ocd anymore. Today, i obsessed a little, and its not too much compared to my usual literally all day long obsessing and ruminating. I think i am learning it, slowly. I am learning that i dont need to share everything with everyone, that most of my thoughts dont mean a shit, that i need to stop trying to be perfect and all that. I am learning to ignore ocd thoughts, slowly. It was much more better than my last 20 days fr. Today was much more fun, i was living and actually doing things other than obsessing and all that. I will be posting some updates because i seriously feel like sharing this with someone, yall pray for me!"

carter_pride,46,I was a lot better when I was a teenager.  Maybe.  Harder for me to do things now.  It’s like there are more barriers inside my head and I keep accumulating more and more of them.  How is this even possible? It’s like every moment - the barriers keep accumulating.  What is wrong with me?  Why are even simple exposures so monumental?

rioboy1985,37,"When I wake I'm pretty vulnerable to OCD. I was so exhausted today and OCD took advantage of that. I caught myself ruminating when I woke up and knew this would wreck my day.  Then I opened Brainlock by Jeffrey Schwartz and read about how these are just false messages coming from my brain. I actually started to believe this and it brought my peace and was so liberating. I started laughing at my OCD for how it could fool me so often. I started to actually believe it was false and lies, and this act helped me break out of the cycle.  I think we're afraid to believe it's lies, because of ""what if?"" But what if we really believed??"
BBlank223,1,"so i just remembered something i did in middle school that was very wrong of me. so like two different people, i think i molested them, so like okay idk if it was molestation cause they seemed okay with it, i mean it could have been a weird first sexual experience but i literally just remembered it.  okay so the first guy, i randomly touched his private area one day in the library, he seemed okay with it, and he let me do it for the whole of the period we were in, and then this weird thing where he let me slap his ass, i do remember him telling me not to do that, i do think i stopped after, and then we kinda started ""dating"" after that(Literally lasted a day technically, it happened on a friday and i ended it on monday).  the second guy, apparently did something simular with the first guy, i don't actually know. so like i poked this guys crotch with the erased part of the pencil, i mean only thing i did and im pretty sure we were friends for atleast two more years after that(i kinda stopped contact with everyone in that school after leaving it). also, weirdly enough bot of these people dated my best friend at the time, not when i did these things, like ehhh.  okay while typing i remembered a weird thing i did, my school was a ""special"" school, basically a school for behavioral problems. we had these break cards, they put different colors in these envelopes every day, so a short amount of time i was able to help with that, i remember rubbing a different persons against my own crotch, i don't know why i did it, i think i was stupid in middle school. don't think it really did anything to the paper cause germs leave paper after a couple of days and i don't think anyone touched it until the next week, also this guy later on sent me a dick pic, i also later found out he sent one to the second guy.  none of them seemed to remember any of these things tbh, like the two people, they didn't really seem to care at all, i mean they never explicitly told me i had permission, but like they seemed okay with it at the time, but now im kinda questioning it all, i never did anything like that again.is this a form of real event ocd?"

pleaseimconfused,21,"hello. i’m 18f. my ocd started getting worse in 2021 winter and now i’m at the point where i don’t leave my room often and skip class because i’m scared i’m going to do something bad or have intrusive thoughts. my themes are mainly sexual.. pocd and harm ocd, although the pocd is kind of reduced now. also i have been irregularly taking my bipolar and antipsychotic medication and i’m not being medicated for my adhd either so maybe that’s making things worse   i left my house to take the train for the first time in a while yesterday and it was 1am. when i was going to grab my seat there was a man that took the seat i was going to take and i had to stand in between him and this guy who was smoking weed, had no mask and coughing and it irritated me just a bit. i started getting these thoughts about “what if i just snapped and assaulted him”. i felt like i wanted to see how far my brain would take me. and since i was standing i felt a speed bump and i had to lean on my foot to keep myself from falling down, but my brain was also using that as a way for me to “act out” my weird revenge fantasy / compulsion. while i was stabilizing myself i pretended in my imagination that i was actually lashing out and going batshit crazy, but in my head i started confusing reality and fantasy and was like wait i don’t want to actually harm anyone and i had a loud voice in my head say “you realize you were actually keeping yourself stable and doing the exact opposite of what your negative thoughts were picturing”. writing this out helped but i can’t tell if this was a compulsion / testing mechanism, genuine desire or a mix of both."

sharksandpickles,45,"I don't know where else to post this and since I have ocd, I wanna know if this is related to it or if it's something completely different or nothing at all. I have obsessions with things that last for a really long time. Last year, I had an obsession with these 2 characters for about 7 months straight. They're all I could think about. I drew them all the time. I listened to their soundtracks all the time. I associated almost every song I listened to with them. I had over 800 pictures of them saved in my gallery. When I woke up in the morning, they would be the first thing I thought about. I constantly did research on them. I even had many dreams of them. Whenever someone insulted those two, I would get really upset. When I saw the other of the characters die, I got so upset that I had to leave my class the next day (asked the teacher to go to the restroom) and my friends kept asking if I was okay.  That obsession is gone now. In march, I started getting obsessed with this one other character... and I cannot stop thinking about him. It's the same thing again. I listen to his character songs, soundtracks, associate different songs with him, draw him a lot, printed multiple pictures of him to my wall, made a pin button of him, have 3 accounts w his name in my username, am buying 2 mangas where he appears the most, keep having dreams where he appears and talk to myself about him. It's been 8 months now... everytime someone says something negative about him, I get really defensive and upset. It's really weird. I wanted to know if this is normal behavior or if I'm wayy too obsessed. I have over 800 pictures of him. I keep saving pictures of him, searching up people's posts and opinions about him etc. and I even downloaded this one game of the anime just to get his card in it. I have memorized many lines and parts of episodes where he appears bc of how many times I've watched the scenes. As I'm writing this down, I'm noticing how much stranger this is than I thought it was. Is this normal? Am I weird?"

Yesterday i spent the whole fucking day just ruminating and obsessing, today i started my day with obsessing and ruminating on a thought that im sure 100% its intrusive. I am tired, I AM TIRED. i dont know how much should i fucking yell and cry and beat myself to feel better, i cant take this anymroe i seriously cant deal with this anymore, nothing is working and i dont feel there is any other way out of this hell other than killing my self which is something i highly want to, like i fantasize about making my fucking stupid brain explode, or returning to binge drinking and smoking.

BBlank223,1,"so i was going through my subscription list on youtube, i subbed to a tea channel, don't know why, anyway they made a video on the Kris Wu situation, and in all honesty i then went into more searching, cause i learn more from readint and i didn't really want to watch a a tea channel for it. anyway i got intrusive thoughts about the death penalty part and then the actual SA accusations(PS:I don't know if it actually is true or not cause they said he admitted to it, but i haven't seen actual evidance he did tho.)  i mean i started getting intrusive thoughts cause i used to read problematic fic smuts, and when i was underage had problematic thought that i fapped too. and i don't want to be like that at all, i mostly think looking into those smut and those thoughts, were actually intrusive thoughts, search compulsions and reacting to a groinal response.  i feel very anxious about this cause, i got intrusive thoughts immediately and a groinal response while searching it, and i hate myself for even looking more into it, reason i did was cause of death penalty clickbait title. and the word or mention of death usually gives me anxiety cause im scared of it, so it was a search compulsion."

The dog has been in our backyard/ garage a couple of times and has pissed on my mother’s car once recently in the driveway. I just have a thought that the dog pissed on my 2 loads that I’ve done. I smelled them and they don’t smell like pee. We have a Ring camera and we didn’t see the dog because it would’ve triggered the camera but there are some blind spots. My mom assured me that 100% the dog didn’t come into the garage. I just have a need to rewash those 2 loads again but I don’t know if this is just a thought or if it actually happened. My mother told me not to wash those as the dog didn’t come over. I don’t want it to have actually happened and have dog piss on my towels and jackets, touching stuff in my room, touching my pc, drying myself down. Please Help"
DangerousFee4,38,"I'm just going to throw this out there for the women to answer.   My sex life has been impacted greatly. I have a massively low drive compared to many other men and women. Also sex can be chore with all the thoughts flowing through my head constantly.   Should I be completely open with my partner about my ocd and anxiety? I've never told a partner what I was going through, I usually have to be intoxicated (couple drinks) to relax or be under the influence of something in order to have sex.   I'm wondering how this would impact my dating life if I opened up to a girl about my struggles with pure o."
rioboy1985,37,"There is an OCD expert called Michael Greenberg. He wrote a number of articles to which I'll post the link below. He said that OCD isn't that complicated. In his view, there is a Core Fear to which we all respond with our own strategies, aimed at making sure that that Core Fear is never realised. He believes that the Core Fear is an emotional state that we're afraid we'll be in forever, if we don't do our compulsions. If we understand this, OCD makes sense, he believes.   I think I would have to agree with him. OCD does seem so random and chaotic. Why would I be looking at my wall to make sure there are no tiny holes in it? Why would I be looking at my car for hours making sure there are no dents? I think because my fear is abandonment, or separation, or something to that effect. My parents  might be angry with me and leave me if I make a mistake or damage something. Maybe if I step on a needle I'll get Hepatitis C and be a social outcast. When you understand OCD through the lens of the Core Fear it really does make sense.  He says that ruminating doesn't really get us anywhere and leaves you more anxious and exhausted. This is helpful as when you're ruminating it's like the issue is the most important thing in the world (is that wheel as round as the others?? Is that a blood stain or tomato sauce on this seat?)   I've been so caught up in my ""own little OCD world"" so many times, thinking it's a life or death situation, only to come out of it and realise it was complete nonsense. It's like when you're dreaming and think you're awake. The dream is nonsense and you think something bad is happening (your relative is dying etc), then you wake up and see how your mind was believing a lie. It's the same with OCD. We need to realise how false OCD really is. We have these false thoughts, with some remote connection to something which makes them feel like they are real.  I used to be terrified of walking on a syringe. I was so terrified that I became convinced I was stepping on syringes and actually feeling them entering into my foot. I would look at my foot and see nothing. When I looked around (for maybe 5-20 minutes)  I'd be unable to find the syringe, yet I'd still feel the pain it made in my foot. Truth is, there never was a syringe, yet my mind could convince me there was one in me!  So, be aware that your mind can play tricks and convince you of stuff like this. The only way out is to not perform the compulsion/ rumination and move forward. I'm finding out that OCD isn't as complex as I thought (yet in many ways it baffles me. I don't fully understand it at all. Just a tad), if I understand that it's an attempt to save me from my Core Fear and also that the thoughts it brings up are far from reality.  https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/articles/"
sharksandpickles,45,"Sometimes I end up arguing w my 8yo brother (while I'm doing my compulsions) and he ends up interrupting my compulsions on purpose to annoy me. I end up getting really mad, yelling at him to stop  (because I get geniunely frustrated bc if I don't do my compulsions I'll obviously feel fucking horrible). I even hit the table real hard just a few minutes ago and feel so bad right now. He knows how it feels for your compulsions to be interrupted bc he himself suffers from it. I feel like such a bad sibling but my ocd has gone so damn bad that I can't even talk to my sister properly because of it. I keep getting annoyed at everyone and everything. I don't wanna be a bad person but I keep getting mad."
tgott1686,28,I had 10 good days in a row but then the last 2 days all my symptoms are back.  Is that normal at this stage in recovery to still have this yo-yo effect back and forth?
Right_now78,41,"i am literally eaten by ocd now, it never got to this level before, i lost my job due to constant compulsions that caused me to be late everyday for work,  taking very long breaks to google a lot of stuff and reassure myself,  i can't concentrate at all due to mental rumination, i almost can't understand what my coworkers say to me when we talk due to my mind being preoccupied about stuff i doubt, questioning every fucking action i do and every word i say whether they're right or not, this things are happening from the moment i wake up til i sleep, all of this lead to addiction, i got a new job that i am about to lose again because the same scenario is being played again... i can't be in a relationship anymore because everytime i do i ruin it with my stupid doubtful brain , it just attacking every side of my life."
massivesmoke,49,"like 2 days ago my dog was in my lap, and i noticed his pp....i had zoophilia ocd before so i had a thought and i think i just tried to shrug it off by saying that his pp is just cute (not in a sexual way, at all) then it all started. Im afraid i truly think his pp is cute, and it wasnt just a way to shrug ocd off, and even tho i dont fear being attracted to animals i highly fear that thinking my dog's pp is cute is a bad thing, like i feel i will get rejected from society if people knew about this...i feel bad and guilty and stressed and i just dont know what i think or feel or what should i do about that. I know this is seemingly ocd, but i just need some help, like some tips on dealing with this guilt and fear. Also, yes, it would be great if i get just one reassurance BECAUSE I AM GOING INSANE i have been holding back for 2 days and i cant anymore, i feel im a horrible person who will never be a respected member of society because i might see that my dog's pp is cute (everything about him in general i see as cute, and every other dog...i just love dogs and they are all so cute and their weird stupid faces)   I AM LOSING MY MIND OVER THIS FFS"
BBlank223,1,"so i have been feeling off almost all afternoon, i think i was having ruminations, it was bouncing from one subject to the next, but my harm ocd always spikes at night, it fucks with me all the goddamn time, i mean after the thoughts come, images of actually doing it just flood my mind, it fucking sucks cause i know i don't want to but apart of me thinks i actually do sometimes cause i doubt myself.  i hate ocd, i was reading a post on this subreddit and it mentioned to word erp, which i somewha read on this therapy, but like i then remembered a post i read awhile ago about someone having harm ocd and doing this therapy with a therapist, they had the person hold a knife to her boyfriends neck, then i had intrusive thoughts of doign that therapy then it turned more dreadful cause it freaked me out.  i mean i don't know what to do, i don't even go anywhere near knives at all, i always ask my mom to hide the knife we have at home, but this fucking sucks, cause like knives always gave me anxiety all the time, but like don't i need to use that for cooking? i mean i don't really cook anyway, but like if i wanted to.  i really just keep myself isolated and safe, but i think it makes it worse cause i talk to no one, except for my family when i leave my room."
Master-Champion-1528,42,"First I want to apologize for bombarding this subreddit for once or twice a day for the whole summer, because yeah I know it’s kind of annoying. Anyways I do want to point out that my medication did work for a time, I had less intrusive thoughts and my compulsions were very minimal. It got to the point where 2 weeks ago I finally left my house to some diligence(s). And I felt the groinal response, but with excercises and just kind of accepting that it will be there and it basically means nothing. I manned up, in fact I was watching youtube videos in my psychiatrist’s office and there was a kid and I didn’t even bother checking, until I noticed and said “wait there’s a kid” then the groinal response came back and my anxiety rose a little, but not too much. I would’ve said I was making progress, and that yeah it might be OCD, but at last I came tumbling down again and my doubt has risen. It started when I watched a few videos on Deltarune, and I saw Ralsei, I’m pansexual, so I like femboys, anyways I wasn’t too much focused on his appearance, but more so his dialogue and his blushing and I kind of like that in a person, and then I started thinking how old is he. And according to the fandom pages he’s around 12-14 I start to panic because I think I was aroused, like not groinal response, and I get terrified. So I start questioning everything, I question if I’m attracted to any other characters in the game that are underage and I first said “No” but since I always found them cute I start to question if I’m mixing both things. I start to panic evn more. So I devloped probably my worst compulsion yet, which is testing. I look up images, of 14 year old girls and boys. And I start to question if I’m attracted or aroused, and I’m always checking evry minute for signs of arousal. I start to question if I’m losing my attraction to adults (I’m going to point out I’m 19, and I think I only fantasized about one girl who was 14 and I was 15, I’ll get to that in a minute it’s really important). So days go bye and my anxiety and compulssions keep getting worse. I was coming to the conclusion, that I’m not attracted to 14 year olds, but as we know it’s never that easy, and I remember that when I was 15 I used to find Bhad Bhabie attractive because of her bust, and I’m just one year older than her, so I give in. I look her up and I’m conflicted, I don’t know what to think yeah I guess the only thing attractive is her bust, but then doubt starts coming and I start to question if I’m genuinely attracted to this person, and I get terrified. And I saw more pictures of her in that age and I saw her more and more like a child. And I get scared and I go back to searching for pics of 14 year olds, because this was the only age I was questioning. I personally don’t want o have sex or date anybody younger than me because other than their bodies are mot fully developed, in my eyes they’re still children, granted growing, but children nonetheless, and even during puberty I found adults way more attractive than people my age. But for some reason my mind starts doubting that, and I get terrified, what if I’m becoming a paedophile. So I talk to my therapist she says this is OCD at work, but even so I just feel like I’m lying to myself and her, and I tell her that and again she says yes it’s OCD, but that for the next visits that are going to be even more frequent, she won’t answer any of these questions because they’re just compulsions. So yeah I’m still kind of horrified by this, and a few days later, I start to doubt myself and question every single age, from both ASAB genders and at first it was a huge no. But then I start to question evrything from, my ideal body types. To using the tanner stage test to see which body was more in line with my preferences. And that would be the end of it, except I start to doubt that too, and I did the worst compulsion for testing myself, and was trying to masturbate, and I couldn’t do it, and this proved that groinal responses are not true arousal, I wish it was the end, but that compulsion hasn’t ended and it’s been days of me trying and I can’t even begin to get an erection. In fact it really disgusts me. But I can’t stop testing myself and I’m terrified, what if it changes or something, or i don’t pay attention to the groinal response it’ll turn into actual arousal. I’m so scared I don’t want this to continue. It disgusts me so much and it feels like I might become one, and everyday that passes feels more and more painful. It feels like I don’t knw myself and wonder is this even OCD at this point. I still maintain my stance I’d rather be dead than be a paedophile, every time I get these images or do the compulsion of testing myself like that I feel sick and horrified. I even doubt what I’m writing because can a person with OCD even be aware, cause sometimes I think what if I’m lying to myself and I’m somehow manipulating people. I’m genuinely terrified, I don’t even want to go outside. And I get scared because, someone said that pedos like being around children, and I do so much testing, that I start to question if I enjoy looking at kids, even though it feels painful like a literal chore I have to do or I’ll go insane or become what I obsess about. I’m really terrified of this and borderline suicidal."
turquoiseturtle01,5,Lately while I watch tv I notice I see cartoon characters in my vision that is mirror from the tv to my vision on the corner of my left eye. Lately I’ve been watching the cartoon Cyberchase on PBS Kids for nostalgic purposes & while watching it I see the characters of Buzz & delete on the side of my vision in still and moving images. Even when I close my eyes I see them. I also noticed I see cartoon characters when I have migraines with aura and it’s so hard to get those images out. I just want to see with my vision normally and rest without seeing things that aren’t there.
Right_now78,41,"i am already diagnosed with OCD and i am 100 % sure that i have BDD but the symptoms are literally the same as ocd's symptoms, i obsess over whether i am ugly or attracrive, i compulsively check my face in  the mirror for a long time until it feels even and it takes a looooooooot of my time, extreme fear of being perceived as ugly, reassurance seeking 24/24 .... if this is not ocd idk what it is"
Sommet_,22,"I think I’m just going to plan to kill myself. I’ll say goodbye to my parents, I had a decent time with friends. Other family members don’t really talk to me. I don’t know when but it’ll probably happen soon. I’m done. OCD wins."
Sommet_,22,"For the past few days a lot of flies have been in the garage. My parents believe something is dead in there as it is starting to smell. Our laundry machines are in the garage and I want to do my wash as I haven’t been able to do it for weeks. The smell along with the flies are making me hesitate to do so because 1, I don’t want the flies to touch my clean clothes and 2, I don’t want the smell to attach itself to my clothes. Am I freaking out or would it be fine if I wash? I’m currently writing this in my room and haven’t stepped foot in the garage since yesterday so I’ll make an update on if it really smells in there."
BBlank223,1,"so i was maladaptive daydreaming, then i remembered this one video i watched randomly, where it was like don't call these phone numbers blah blah, i watched it like a couple of years ago.anyway one of the numbers was like, if you say a name then the numbe will call back with the person screaming. i randomly then thought of like what if i said my own name? then it turned into what if i said a kpop idols name, don't know if i was having intrusive thoughts, or was apart of the maladaptive daydreams. but i feel alittle upset cause i don't want to hurt anyone, but i also feel really calm cause i know it wasn't really my intention to think that."
BBlank223,1,"So was masturbating to gay porn, then straight ads popped up didnt want to see vaginas(cause I'm actually gay) and then I started having intrusive thoughts about my mom which ewww, anyone else hate when fapping you get intrusive thoughts about family.  I think I was having ruminations about something before I fapped but idk."
Sommet_,22,"I can’t leave my room. I’ve slept on the floor for 3 weeks already and haven’t washed some of my clothes in a month. I tried to not overwhelm myself by only washing half my loads today but I can’t even do fucking one. I just fucking gave up. I’ve been trying to finish my wash for weeks now, my rooms a mess. I bet it’s fucking luxury for people to just do their laundry without worrying about the smallest, most stupidest shit. I’m in my room again, making this post and sleeping again. Every fucking day. I posted similar shit a week ago, I thought I would’ve been done with this but nope, if you recognize my user, yeah this shit is still going. Like I can’t function. I don’t think i’ll ever sleep in my bed because I just can’t fucking finish.  That’s all I want, 2 days to just do my laundry, clean my room, and get out of this shit that has progressed immensely the last month. What’s amazing is that all my clothes combine for 6 large loads. I managed to turn 6 loads into over 20 by rewashing due to me not feeling like my clothes are clean or if they touched something. At this point, I’m never leaving my room, this is a safe place, I’m weak as fuck and can’t decide shit. I’m stuck with my demons in this cubicle.  Here’s my whole month for you: Try to do laundry, overwhelmed myself, get pissed, go to sleep, wake up, see others washing so I patiently wait, go to sleep wake up, try to do laundry, see something provoking my OCD, go to sleep. It’s a fucking cycle. This is my life. Sleep, eat, OCD, and other mental illnesses. That’s it, I should kiss my fucking ambitions goodbye this isn’t the life. Only reason I haven’t taken my own life is because my parents. Some Dm’d me with great advice but I only took that so far. My life’s fucked, my minds fucked. Yep this is great. I’m also becoming really aggressive, like I want to hurt others. But this isn’t an intrusive thought I don’t think. I think about it, never once wanted to hurt my parents, I’d rather severely injure myself than to lay a finger on them. I just want to get my aggression out. I can only imagine the brain activity in someone’s brain who does have a mental illness or chemical imbalance. At this point, I just want peace"

NameIntrepid,9,I saw someone make a post about people with schizophrenia make meaningless connections or have these like ‘delusions’. A lot of the things I go through because of my OCD make me feel like I have schizophrenia. Shit freaks me out so much. I don’t have visual or auditory hallucinations but I’m super hyperaware all the time and my eyes mistake random things around me as something else for a split second. I also constantly create random situations in my head that have to do with what I’m doing at that moment. From what I read that seems like some sort of delusional thinking.
BBlank223,1,"so i was listening to music having maladaptive daydreams, anyway for some reason i put my hands in top of my head and bottom of my chin and twisted my head slightly, and i got freaked out cause intrusive thoughts about wanting to snap my own neck. i fucking hate this, i was originally doing it cause in maladaptive daydreams was cracking neck i think, i kinda forgot cause i got scared. i was already having harm ocd cause of criminal psycology and true crime and the luca magnotta case. about how i could possibly hurt someone like he did. and i was just calming that down already.  i fucking hate this, i want ocd to be over, im on a low dose of medicine for ocd but it doesnt really help my intrusive thoughts or ocd at all. im supposed to go to therapy in 5 days and in 6 days i have an appiontment with med management doctor, im gonna ask to go up atlease 2-3 doses cause im on the second lowest dose. i don't think im explaining my medicine correctly.  how do you get rid of intrusive thoughts?"
BBlank223,1,"I get intrusive thoughts about harming my mother, it only usually either harming myself or her, dont know if it cause I do carry slight resentment for something that is not her fault, I mean I dont hate my mother it just I am holding a grudge which i really need to let go of, but I feel like it interacts with my intrusive thoughts.  Like I hate that at midnight when I might be able to sleep soon os when I get most of my harm ocd thoughts, like i get almost every other theme throughout the day."
turquoiseturtle01,5,A few weeks ago the thieves in my neighborhood returned walking around early in the mornings. One of the thieves also has started walking alone in the evenings casing my neighborhood. That has put me on edge and my OCD and paranoia has increased since. I got back into the habit of constantly checking my security cameras and been having a hard time sleeping again. I have been sending the officers evidence of photos and videos of the thieves through email. Plus the other day I found this strange blue straight lined blue chalk marking on my sidewalk with a white chalk mark through it and I worry that the thieves drew that to target my house. One of the officers contacted me through a phone call that there should be police patrolling my neighborhood if they are available and that a detective might be assigned to the case.  Also I have been getting headaches lately from overthinking. My left side of my head still gets a cold pressure and tingles. I noticed too that I still get closed eye hallucinations of my front yard when my eyes are closed and it’s hard to get those images away when I sleep and rest.

BBlank223,1,"so i once got my hand dirty cause i was fapping, i washed my hands like 5 times before i touched anything else, i decided to make myself toast after washing my hands, so i touched the jelly to spread toast, i asked my mom to make me penut butter and jelly today, i was to lazy to make it myself, well we had 2 of the same flavored jelly in the fridge, and i grabbed the one i didn't touch for her but it ran out. so i grabbed the other one and held it, she touched it for a second, i made her wash her hands after spreading it on one of the sandwiches.  i took the sandwich that she touched after touching the thing cause i thought it would be weird if she did eat that one. anyway i still think she ate something dirty aswell and its freaking me out."

BBlank223,1,"so recently i accidentally got back into porn/smut with taboo things, mostly incest, i hate the step brother porn that got me back into reading incest smut, i hate myself cause it leads to intrusive thoughts, its not like i was searching for that stuff, it was mostly just i saw a video and felt compelled to click on it.  now im questioning everything, there is a reason im trying nofap, cause i hate dealing with this. it fucks me up.  i got back into reading/ seeing hentai with shota in it, and i hate that topic to cause i know im not into any of that but why does my brain immediatally need to click on something i know fucks with me.  i feel like a fucking monster."
BBlank223,1,"like i noticed cause of my maladaptive daydreams that most of my think i just force thoughts, intrusive thoughts usually pop in aswell. but like it feels like im mouthing the words, bur withougt opening my mouth, does anyone else think like that? i mean i'm kinda doing it while typing.  cause i also feel i literally have no thoughts outside of maladaptive daydreams or intrusive thoughts. and it fucking scares me that these are the only things i can think about, like how do you make friends or start dating if you can't really focus on them with thoughts, it bugs me that i can't think outside of those.  i mean i probably do but don't notice. i do think it also affects my conversational skills.  anyway whoever reads this have a nice day"
PeteyZee1998,24,"When you see compulsions online on OCD google photos, most people are seen washing their hands,   my last psych said i didnt have ocd because he observed no compulsions such as hand washing which is bullshit. OCD isn't a stereotype.  &#x200B;  all 4 other psychiatrists agreed i had OCD.  &#x200B;  this post is not about me, but can compulsions also be considered as reassurance seeking, and not just washing your hands or counting blocks or books? or needing to check the door.  For example, can you have an obsession about a sickness? and than use the internet to somehow reassure you, that you do not have the illness, and feel you need to do this over and over, is that considered a compulsion too?"
PeteyZee1998,24,Its so bad that most of the time i am oblivious theblatant obsession i have is actually OCD
Sommet_,22,"I have a continuous thought that my brother dips my body scrubbing loaf in the toilet and hangs it back up. Yesterday was a really, really bad day for me and my OCD but my parents came in to help calm me down. I heard him sigh by the other room. I have some thoughts of him sabotaging my stuff ad a good chunk of my OCD is triggered from him. I don’t know what to do about this. I feel like confronting him will have that thought in his head and he might actually do it. I tried smelling my body scrubber but it didn’t smell bad. It’s either don’t ask anything and constantly be think that. Or approach him but have the possibility of him actually doing it since what I said is out there already. My mother says he’s not like that but I don’t know for sure. I don’t want to rub my body with a scrubber that had toilet water on it. I don’t know what to do"
BBlank223,1,"so i was just swapped themes like 10 minutes ago, and my thoughts are what would happen after i killed someone, well hold on im gonna explain better, so i was having thoughts about plastic forks in general, and then i was somewhat upset my mom forgot to buy some, and i was slightly have some harm ocd thoughts abit before but i somewhat brushed them off.  anyway i had a thought about stabbing my mother, i usually have intrusive thoughts about harming myself aswell, anyway i then got an intrusive thought almost quickly after about maybe if i was in prison they'd have plastic forks, or something along the lines of that, and tbh i started having anxiety, so i really dont remember, but i think its simular.  also question, can intrusive thought happen if you have deep trust issues and somewhat anger at someone? cause i do know that i have slight anger at my mother, i don't hate her at all, and its somewhat over past issues i really need to let go. plus the anger is somewhat subconscious, like it is somewhat anger over something that is not her fault, i think its misplaced anger anyway, cause i don't really feel angry with her. i have alot to talk about in therapy  anyway i feel like talking about my problems here makes me feel slightly less anxious and takes my mind off of it tbh. like i just let it off my chest.   anyway whoever reads this, have a nice day :)"

It takes me 5 hours to do one fucking load. I made countless posts the past few days and everyone is helpful but I just can’t. I just took an anxiety pill but I want to take more but too scared to take more because what I did in the past. I keep washing the same fucking loads over and over and over and over again.

You suddenly relax and do what your doing, out of no where you get this scent or you get this weird feeling from a traumatic event you experienced but have no images of it or even think of the event, all of a sudden you feel like it is happening all over again, you may feel anxious, and distressed you are feeling like this, you may feel like your brain is clogged and stuck on this one ''feeling'', to the point you obsess over it, and it just gets worse and worse and it psychically drains you. After the event, you feel anhedonia, depression, you lose interest in life, and just feel so shit, that you start preparing for the ''aftershocks''. Once the Aftershocks hit, these can linger with you for weeks, before another full blown episode.  Can i receive hospital care for this if it gets bad enough?"
Sommet_,22,"Already the 4th fucking post about this shit. I can’t function properly. I tried my best to wash all of my loads but only did one. I always feel as though my brother comes from work and spits in either the washer or dryer. And I have the urge to fucking wash everything again. I already washed one of my loads 3 times, my towels 3 times, and sheets 4 fucking times. This time I made sure to stand near the door where the washer and dryer is to make sure it’s true or not or if it’s my fucking OCD. I don’t think I heard the dryer or washer door open but now I just fucking wasted 2 loads and threw them on the ground. I haven’t slept in my bed for weeks. I’ve literally been waking up, doing my loads, feeling they are dirty, abandon the load, then sleeping. I managed to wash 2 loads in this 3 week long journey but now I want to wash those too because the load in the dryer touched those on my bed. I can’t take it anymore"
BBlank223,1,"So I was watching a trolling in vr chat video, anyway they started using real life props like for example, a trampoline, they started doing front and back flips, just tiny ones, I have actual serious anxiety from seeing any flips, cause I start to get ruminations of not landing it right if I did one, i never want to do flips anyway.  But I watch a youtuber do a flips and it look like he landed on his neck not really sure, but I started having ruminations about that video, they did a slow mow of it, the guy was fine, he still posts videos, anyway I started feeling phantom feelings in my neck and now I'm scared I'll impulsively do a flip and then land wrong.  I am the most clumsy person I know, I can barely walk right sometimes, so I hate seeing flips cause now I'm anxious about it."
BBlank223,1,"So I recently realized that I think in a weird way I think, so I have maladaptive daydreams and I usually do them in my head, but I realized the how I think is.  Like if you mouth words but with your mouth closed, when I dont do that it feels like my head is empty. Do I just have literally no thoughts at all, I'm literally doing that while typing right now.   I do it while reading silently aswell its feels like I'm just speaking in my head, I weirdly feel a sensation in my mouth while thinking.   It's also probably apart of my speech problems. It feels like I'm forcing thoughts and cant come up with anything on my own. What I mean by that is my brain is usually empty, I tried to stop thinking like that but I was afraid I'd either fall asleep or space out.  Does anyone else think like this?"
Sommet_,22,"A dog from next door peed on my mom’s rim of her car. My dad went out to pour a bowl of water onto it. I’m doing my laundry and I feel that my laundry is contaminated with the dog’s piss. What I mean is that my dad was walking back and forth by the dryer. I feel as though his feet were contaminated from walking near the dog’s piss and he walked near the pathway of the washer and dryer. I then go out to put my laundry in the dryer but I’m not sure if one of my jackets touched the ground he walked on. I usually take out one garment at a time, scrunch it into a ball then put it in the dryer. But I don’t know if my OCD is making me feel this way or if my jacket actually touched the ground. Sometimes it’s hard what’s real when OCD makes you question everything. I don’t think I would position my body down far enough for my jacket to reach but I just don’t know"
Right_now78,41,"YES it is in my fucking head u stupid bitch , where else is it gonna be ? it IS in my head, literally."
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,I am a germaphobe with bad contamination OCD and I come to work this morning to find my Peanut butter pretzels open and I'm positive someone ate them. I got them yesterday and nobody here washes their hands after the bathroom. 🙃😑😐 Exposure therapy? I had a handful. Regretting it.
PeteyZee1998,24,"when your thought becomes stuck and you obsess over a past event to the point you feel like you are relieving that event again? as well as extremely distressing themes of dissociation, hyperawareness of the feeling, to the point it causes significant impairment and distress? that a thing?? any way to manage it. Meds have helped heaps but last week they stopped working"
DangerousFee4,38,"Can't enjoy anything anymore, wasted the past 20 years unemployed , not achieving my goals and going to become homeless.   Can't feel excited, enjoyment, pleasure. Chronic pure o thoughts and feelings everyday all day.   Life is not even enjoyable. I don't want to get to the finish line and achieve nothing, mine as well end it now before I waste my life in pain and suffering."
Sommet_,22,"This [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/q5jfo6/almost_done/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) happened yesterday. I wake up today feeling a bit better and I told myself to do each load of laundry one at a time, to take my time. But I always feel like every time my brother comes home from work, he sabotages my loads. I try to rationalize or think about it logically as to why, is this just my OCD? My mother says he’s not like that but I’m not sure. So my plan was to do all 6 loads of my laundry which then turned to 3 which then turned to me only finishing one fucking load because I had that feeling, the other 2 loads I just fucking threw on the floor in my room. I’ve washed some loads multiple times because of this. I only managed to finish my towels after having washed them 3 fucking times but I feel tempted to wash them again because the clothes that I irrationally thought were contaminated from my brother coming home, I put next to the towels on my bed but the decided to put that on the floor and leave my towels on my bed. I’ve slept on the floor for a week and a half with almost all of my clothes still not washed because I can’t fucking do this shit. My body hurts and I don’t know when I’m going to get this shit done. I haven’t slept in my bed in weeks either."
massivesmoke,49,"i dont know what to say, i have weird thoughts. LAtely i obsessed about weird shit, like super weird. OCD made me realize what wrong shit i did, why i did it, and made me have good arguments about some things. but is this my life now? i see a child and get terrified, i see an animal and get terrified, i make up weird scenarios in my mind and overthink the proper answer, i make up weird scenarios in my mind and see if i get sexual pleasure from them. What am i now? how did i reach this point of madness? is my brain even a normal human brain at this point? i feel like it will explode, im not sure. I feel bad about these thoughts, how did i let myself reach this? i feel i will never live normally again, if everything got normal i will not forget these thoughts that came to my mind, and like if i have a gf what would i tell her? yeah i just spent whole fucking days imagining things about children and animals to make sure im not attracted to them? sorry i obsess about the age of consent and shit like that? sometimes im not sure about weird shit that i hate like if a teenager can consent? im not sure if i would kill a child to get the love of someone? whoever knows i obsess about these things usually gets disgusted, and i get called a pedophile or something, sometimes i dont even know how moral or sane or right i am because of all this. Can i ever get back to normal? to life before all this shit happened?   i feel that life is just a prison at this point, i dont think i will ever feel truly happy or cling to life anymore, i just cant wit to die. Since my ocd got bad few months ago and i drown myself in every unhealthy thing, i cant wait to die, to one day just have a heart attack (im surprised i didnt have one after all the smoking, drinking, stressing, and binge eating) or im not sure if i want to get diagnosed with cancer but what was one day my ocd theme, is now a wish"
littledaisy_07,8,"As if it wasn’t just the compulsions, obsessions,... we often end up with physical symptoms (stomach aches, head aches, shaking, sweating,... for me), unbearable fatigue, feeling mentally drained, struggles to function on a daily-basis,... there are just so many. I hate this shitty disorder"
BBlank223,1,"so i was watching a past genshin impact stream and the person who was streaming was talking about gatcha, my intrusive thought went to harm ocd and stealing someones credit card, and i kinda hate that cause i don't want to hurt anyone, but i feel fucked up cause it seems more like an actual thought then intrusive, i feel very anxious right now, and very annoyed cause i was for for the past 4ish hours, am i just fucked up? i hate ocd"
Right_now78,41,"the thought is that i am a toxic person that should fixes his behavior, and i feel that if i don't think about it  and analyze it enough i won't be able to discover what that toxic behavior is so i can change it."
Sommet_,22,"I can’t do this shit anymore, I haven’t washed my clothes in over 3 weeks. I’ve been sleeping on the floor for a week now because my sheets aren’t clean but it’s mentally exhausting to do my wash. Every fucking day is hell. I feel dirty everyday, then I procrastinate because I try my hardest to clean then something triggers me then I give up and try the next day. But I then feel sleepy and sleep through the day and don’t feel productive. I feel as though washing this much will damage the washer and I won’t have clean clothes. I don’t know what to do anymore"
shadowXXe,44,Might be less idk I stopped counting and caring. I no longer enjoy days I just get through them this has been my longest ever episode. I do still have hope it's going to end like my TOCD did but I don't know I managed to Almost beat it once then I got triggered again and again and once more the backdoor spikes suck too. Can't wait to start therapy soon and show OCD he really has the captain's chair
littledaisy_07,8,"OCD (and my perfectionism) linked to it make it extremely hard for me to hand in assignments. I end up rereading everything for hours and I get behind and today, I couldn’t complete the whole thing. I’m terrified. I want it to stop"
massivesmoke,49,"i feel like i want to get on a tv show, that everyone in the world is watching, AND THEN TELL MY WHOLE STORY WITH POCD, EVERY SINGLE THOUGHT, EVERY SINGLE COMPULSION, EVERY SINGLE THING, EVERYTHING!   how do i deal with this?"
massivesmoke,49,"my ocd has been taking very werid themes lately, like what if i would kill a child if someone i love asked me to, or what if im not a pedophile but have some pedophilic attractions. If i talk abou the details of these obsessions i probably would be considered either insane, on drugs, or should be thrown in an asylum. Im not sure of anything anymore, it keeps coming, i just obsess about weird and stupid things all the time and like im not sure how stable i am anymore, last week i thought about smashing my head into the walls until my brain gets enough damage to never obsess again, now i feel like i may need to concentrate all my issues in a part of my body and cut it, so my stupid brain will work with this metaphor and i will be free of ocd. Sometiems i really think that i should be famous just so i can confess to like millions of peopleabout all this nonsense that happens in my brain, i feel obligated to tell everyone. One day im sure about everything the other day im questioning how moral i am or if im attracted to people i never felt attracted to. Its crazy, im crazy, i dont think im still near the point of being able to return to normal, i feel like im just disfigured, shattered and rearranged randomly, i casually get thoughts about throwing myself right off the window or shoot myself, im not sure anymore. I think im about to go officially insane, like at this rate i will soon lose any kind of logical thinking to determine my morals and what should i do in terms of morals and behavior and stuff, i seriously feel like im holding myself back from just bating myself to death or stab my brain until it stops"
BBlank223,1,"so when ever i think, its usually me forcing thoughts. or intrusive thoughts. but like my head is basically empty it feels like unless im maladaptive daydreaming or having intrusive thoughts, or forcing myself to think. these are my problems this morning, i have other problems but i already talked about it here, like does anyone else feel like their head is just empty unless you are forcing thoughts?"
tgott1686,28,It pooped out on me after 13 years.  It’s been 6 months.  Do you think it will work again at some point?
BBlank223,1,"someone shot me, in the penis. when i was taken to the hospital they didnt really check the area i was shot and since i was like half awake, cause i was apparently still aware of things actually around me. i could feel my penis still and in my dream after i went to dinner with the people who shot me. then they asked me something and then i was like ""Idk ill ask my mom"" or something like that, which teleported me back home, with the other people and dinner, and then my mom was walking around topless. just wearing a bra, and then i was washing my hands and my mom walked out and then was wearing a shirt which was a relief and then i woke up.  idk if this dream had anything to do with ocd or not, or the ocd medication. but uh i hate having vivd dreams, i also when i was going to sleep was having an ocd theme, and intrusive thoughts so i was anxious while going to sleep.  anyway have a nice night"
Right_now78,41,"i just watched a video of how people with ocd brain is like, and i found out there is a huge difference between our brain and neurotypical people's brain, so how can Therapy fix that ?"
purple07631,15,"I'm afraid to go to sleep again today. Normally I would feel like dying, but today I'm just scared. I recently got a new hobby, which makes every day a little more fun. But I'm afraid to go to sleep now. I know it is better for my body to sleep, and right now I feel like I want to live, so I have to sleep. It's hard when you're in a hurry to go to sleep because of the extra stress. But I can't find the courage to take the medicine to sleep. What should I do?"
littledaisy_07,8,"I’m so anxious. They’re so cute and I’d feel like a terrible person if I harmed them yet, OCD keeps on giving me thoughts about doing so and I’m so anxious, sad and ashamed...I feel like a terrible person I need some support please 😔😞"

BBlank223,1,"does it effect your masturbation and porn/smut watching/reading, cause i realized i have a weird compulsion for more taboo porn, and i hate it, cause it then gives me intrusive thoughts, about actual people in my life, and i don't want that. i want to be normal thoughts and to rewire my brain.  also does anyone get harm ocd in the middle of masturbation? cause it happens alot, probably cause i have read dark shit before and fapped to it. not proud of it and kinda think im a monster for it now.  like i don't even think im aroused by any of it, i jsut think masturbation for me is a compulsion then what i consume while trying to finish is a searching compulsion. or i just fap out of boredom. or reacting to a groinal response.  is there anyway to stop? i have been trying nofap but i only make it one day,every couple of days and then i relapse as they call it.   anyway have a nice day/night"
mickNcheez,23,Has anyone ever had like a somatic type of ocd where you are hyper aware that you are alive and making decisions and everything? How did y’all deal with that if u have?
tgott1686,28,"Has anybody on zoloft, Prozac, Paxil, celexa or lexapro had one poop out and have another work right after?"
BBlank223,1,"like the title says, i sometimes get intrusive thoughts about people dying, like family, celebrities, i would say friends but i dont have any, and its making me then have the intrusive thought that i want them to die, or expect it to happen soon, i blame my mdd cause when i get out of a daydream is when my intrusive thoughts and imagination is most active, so that's when these thoughts pop up.  i hate having them its kinda like, easiest explination is sometimes when something or someone is trending on twitter i somehow get anxious and expect there to be something about death of some celebrity or idol, its very weird but i guess i just expect the worst of things sometimes,  or like i expect to hear about some sort of car crash or heartattack, or someone in house attacking my family. and i hate having these thoughts like i expect it to happen today, and how would i react to it.  i feel awful cause its like im imagining someone dying, and i dont want them to die. but my intrusive thoughts just popped in while writing this part, and it was saying how it would be easier if they did.... FUCK OCD.   why does this disease make me think of myself as a monster, or have these thoughts i hate this  is this some weird form of harm ocd?  EDIT: added some things"
NameIntrepid,9,My head is just so crowded with thoughts. I feel as if I’m a completely different person. I can’t speak and constantly stutter in front of people. I feel this overwhelming sense of guilt all the time.. idk what’s going on anymore at this point. What is real and what isn’t? The lines feel so blurred I’m scared that I’ll do something even though I know deep down I won’t. I hate this feeling so much.
tgott1686,28,Has anybody had lexapro work after celexa pooped out on them or vice versa?
tgott1686,28,If celexa pooped out on me after 3 years and then Luvox and clomipramine both didn’t work?
BBlank223,1,"So I used to read dark smut, which was very harmful to my mental health now, it was very violent and stuff in some, anyway I remember not technically being aroused by it, but I still fapped to it it was a very dark fic where there was death and then they did stuff with the dead body, it makes me sick that I actually read it.  I think it was a weird compulsion from my ocd that made me click it. But like does this make me a monster? It was fictional and I wasn't into it, it was like one fic in the 30ish I read while fapping the couple of times that I did read with that topic. I hate myself.  And now I'm having intrusive thoughts cause I did read it,""what if I hurt someone like that"". I dont want to hurt anyone. I hate how this is a problem. But I kinda brought it upon myself. And I hate it and I hate anxiety, i want to sleep the rest of the day tbh. So I cam have a break from my brain."
shadowXXe,44,Came in the mail today i have the option of going to an in-person clinic or doing online sessions currently deciding which one is better for me. I'll tell you this could not have come at a better time!
BBlank223,1,"so i decided to open my twitter app, which actually gets notifs from nsfw twitters cause i used to look at those all the time, anyway i ignored the notif, kinda. i clicked on one and read abit, but then i stopped after the first two lines, it was a smut writing thingy, anyway after i ignored it, i was already having a groinal response anyway so i decided to mess with my grion area cause i was like it would go away if i just fapped, but i decided to look up a twitter of a kpop group cause that's kinda the reason why i opened twitter, i wasn't fapping at that point cause tbh i didn't want to was still touching myself abit tho, but when i looked into the twitter to see if i followed them i got an intrusive thought wondering if i was going to come across a post about if a person died.  anyway i was still touching myself at this point i stopped after that thought, masturbation is one of my compulsions in general, i hated that i was touching myself at that point, i didn't realize i was until that thought came across,  anyway i actually decided to go to nsfw twitter and fap anyway cause i was told, that if you just stop it gives more power to the thoughts, and it was lined up with intrusive thoughts, and i hated it.  i feel very morbid tbh even though i know i wasn't really aroused at all, just reacting to a groinal response.  i hate that i was fapping to nsfw twitter about kpop idols and to the actual group twitter when i was touching myself, i feel ashamed cause i want to be a normal fan and i don't like looking at these guys sexually, and was mostly just the explination of what people were talking about what they'd do to these men, but still.   i find it creepy that i did that, i want to be a normal fan of this without guilt about it, i just also want to be normal in general but ocd doesnt help at all with that."
littledaisy_07,8,It’s stronger than I am. I can’t fight anymore. I’m tired. I reduced my compulsions as much as I could but the anxiety is unbearable. I don’t want to fight anymore.

massivesmoke,49,"so i was just literally vibing when my dog came and SNIFFED my private area, and then i worried i let him do it to get sexual gratification, i noticed i might be waiting a second or two before pushing him away from me. I should state that i dont feel attracted to him at all, i feel kinda violated when he does that, and that i cant seem to be sure about what i did before So here are my theories on it that i reached after thinking for a while:  1-i dont like, and i be just focused on something else and need a moment to realize whats happening  2-i wait for him to stop on his own as he might smell things sometimes once or twice then leave em on his own, and if he doesnt its when i push him away from me  3-maybe because it reminds me of my scent, which i like (we like how we smell, its something programmed into us)  4-i know he doesnt think its sexual, i know im not attracted to him, i know he just likes the scent and thats why i dont react strongly to it.  5-i let him do it because i know it makes him happy and doesnt give anyone sexual gratification and i just let him because i know he likes it until he touches me badly  6-i know its harming nobody and that he isnt doing something sexual from his POV (so im not abusing him sexually or exploiting him or anything) soi just let him then realize he shouldnt be sniffing my private area or soething  &#x200B;  what do you think? is it an ocd pattern? do i have a serious problem? am i evil? was i abusing my dog sexually? or is it a stupid mistake and innocent and i shouldnt overthink it? im lost, but i will never let him sniff me again ever at all, and i should say that i love him to death as a friend and sometimes he feels like my son, so i dont think of him sexually at all and dont have any intention to harm him and NO animals cant consent so im not going to say that its his choice or something/   note: i had zoophilia theme with ocd before."
massivesmoke,49,"as much as i know about the anatomy of our brains with ocd,its that 3 areas are hyperactive (1 responsible for determining if omething is right or wrong, one that gives anxiety, one that laggs and doesnt forget about the casual random subject) but what causes the thoughts themselves? knowing this helped me with ocd so i think extra things will help too"
massivesmoke,49,"im dead, i cant take it anymore and thinking about starting to use some ocd medicine. But i havea question for those who use it, does it really work? does it help? what are the side effects? (as much as i know some things for example anti depressants can cause a dramatic increase in weight or lower sex drive a lot). Do you recommend me any herb a an alternative?"
BBlank223,1,"So I was reading a fanfic, my maladaptive daydreaming kicked in, where I was imagining being questioned by the police for murder. Dont know why my brain did that, probably apart of the harm ocd aswell maybe. Anyway I then started getting intrusive thoughts aswell where I actually hurt someone or felt a weird urge like I wanted to.  Like do you understand those feelings, when you get an intrusive though with harm ocd there is this weird urge, making you think you actually want to hurt someone.  Anyway I get these intrusive thoughts about stabbing my mother while she sleeps, I get super anxious after, i told her about these thoughts before, I'm just glad she didnt think i was insane,  i mean she doesnt really understand the thoughts but still.  I feel awful that one of my thoughts that help calm me down, is that i need her so i could eat, not that i love my mother. It always makes me feel guilty cause i do love my mother.   Also question, does thinking someone else is gonna hurt you apart of harm OCD?  Cause I always think my brother is gonna hurt me, or that he would do what o just explained.   I feel crazy. I'm scared. I feel emotionally numb.  Anyway I'm gonna try and calm down, venting somewhat helps me.   I'm gonna try and be positive for rest of day, have a nice day whoever reads this"

BBlank223,1,"I feel very emotionless,  I think i have a numbness right now, Due to depression. Where I feel emotionally numb. So sometimes when intrusive thoughts come I feel slightly anxious. I just had an intrusive thought, about true crime. And it makes me feel like I have no care or no feelings, which is weird cause my mom says I have alot of compassion and care. But then I get guilt tripped for not calling my grandparents often. Which is my fault and I feel guilty enough as it is.  I feel very selfish all the time cause my intrusive thought tried to convince me that I only care about my mom and grandparents when I need something. Which is slightly true with my mom. What I mean by that is I have tried to start conversations, but I usually only talk to her when I need food or something. I feel awful for it. I think it's also the isolating.  I isolate myself alot cause I really have nothing else to do but isolate. I recently started using tinder cause I wanted to start dating, well originally I wanted to make friends on bumble but the swiping on that made me want to make tinder. Anyway I ghost people on there which is awful. I hate that I do it. But it's mostly cause idk what to talk about. Or how to meet new people. I dont feel to well all the time. I realized this rant is not really about ocd at all tbh. Just the intrusive thoughts part.i just needed to get stuff off my chest.  My intrusive thoughts fuckong suck cause they try to convince me that I'm the worst person, that I dont really care, sometimes they try to convince me that I'm into people I shouldn't be. Or that I'm not gay, or that I'm trans, which im not. But it tries to convince me of things that im not. I'm sick of it. I hate this. I want it to end.  I know therapy is a slow process and I'm somewhat slightly anxious about it. But like does it ever get better?"

I dont feel like myself. All i ever feel is anxiety, shame, hate and anger. People have been advising me on ow to beat this and while i thank them for their advice sometimes its easier said than done im still waiting on my so-called referral to therapy they said it would be 2 weeks its been a month im not trying to sound entitled but its hard not to get a little frustrated when my life is falling apart in-front of me  and all I'm offered is ""I'm sorry its taking so long we'll try get you seen as soon as possible"" but i don't blame them as much as I am frustrated they are just doing their job"
purple07631,15,"It's hard. I'm having a hard time financially right now, so I went to my grandmother's house and told her I needed some money.

I'm really ashamed of myself. My grandmother said she was sorry, she didn't have any money right now. I felt even more ashamed of myself.  I'm sorry, Grandma. I want to get over my OCD, get a job, and apologize to my grandmother. I want to apologize to her for begging for money. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I won't do it again, so please forgive me. I can't sleep thinking about it. I'm afraid to go to sleep. I'm afraid to think that God won't forgive me and will make me die if I sleep. I'm afraid to go to bed today and tomorrow and every day.

massivesmoke,49,"ocd always comes, it eventually has to come and ruin my life for a while. Today i spent all the time (nearly 6 hours and a half) from the moment i woke up to a while ago, just thinking and obsessing. And it is still coming back but i deal with it my way, and im tired. I thought i finally had a chance to live free from my own mind, my head is weird, im feeling drained and tired, my teeth have something wrong with them which im sure is a result of all the stress, i feel so tired. why i cant just get to have a new chance at life without ocd, i will not waste that, i seriously cant wait to die and dont want to exist again at all costs, i dont want to ever worry about something ever i just want to be in peace, i wanted to live ""healthy"" but now  i really feel like drinking and smoking and eating shit unhealthy food so i can die faster. i cant imagine living with this for one more year  im just tired, very very very tired and i dont know what to do anymore"
massivesmoke,49,"one thought appears, and it leads to another thought. over and over and over and over AND OVER   i ended up wondering if i like weird things, i dont know what happened to me. I was just so happy and my ocd was very under control then for some reason this happened, i feel like killing myself to set myself free. How can i make my brain just stop worrying about things that are stupid, how cani make it create problems and then try to solve it?"
BBlank223,1,"so im the worst caller and texter i hate calling and texting tbh, i also usually prefer calling over texting, anyway i called my mom to ask where she was, cause she wasn't home atm, and she was at my grandparents, my mom then told me that my grandmother said something along the lines of ""if he didnt care to call now why would he later"" or ""he basically doesnt care"".  i got so pissed cause im really tired of guilt trips cause they usually set off my intrusive thoughts, i used to be scared of my grandmother when i was younger(she used to spank me). and i was so scared that one time she had to babysit me cause my mom was with my brother in the hospital, that i called her a monster, i still feel extremely guilty about that.  i just dont like interacting with people sometimes, and right now im so focused on myself and this disease called ocd that is hurting my brain, that i dont think of calling. im the most introverted cause i dont like talking to my own family sometimes.  i understand that she just lost her sister and i should be more understanding about that, and maybe she wanted her grandkids to show more care and ask her how she is, i usually ask my mom how she is and what they were up to when she gets home or after she's done talking on the phone with them.  it makes me feel upset that people guilt trip me, cause i have ocd which makes me feel guilty almost all the time. and i was finally out of an ocd theme and was fine for an hour, but now the intrusive thoughts are flooding back. and im just pissed, i shouldn't be but i am"
DangerousFee4,38,"My quality of life is disgusting compared to others.   Every area of mt life is gone and haven't been stable enough to enjoy anything in the past 15 years.   I'm exhausted and tired. Do I just give up and accept that I'm a loser with a shit brain that didn't develop properly.  Even modern medicine and therapy doesn't help, that's 15 years of trying different treatments available.   I truly think ocd is just a shitty brain , structure and chemical didn't develop properly and know how to live the rest of your life in isolation and pain.   This is absolutely disgusting way to live, my family and I don't desvere this.   I'm so angry and feed up"
purple07631,15,"Can someone please help me? Even more medication won't help. I don't have money to go to therapy or counseling. Do I have to die? It's so painful before I sleep that there are no tears to shed. I am filled with a sense of hopelessness. Is there no choice but to die? There is no way to overcome the fear of sleep, no way to get over OCD. There is probably no one who understands. I want a friend who understands. I have many, many, many fantasies of what I wish I could be every night, and then I suddenly come back to reality and feel sad. I also hate the fact that I am quite fat. I hate this world that places so much emphasis on body type. I hate that I was born with a disease or disability. What choice do I have but to live, no matter how hopeless I feel? I don't know anymore. I can't bear to live in despair. I can't bear to be forced to live. I have lived no matter how hopeless I am. But, you know, in the case of mental illness, why do we have to live? In the case of physical illness, there is death. My mind is already at its limit. If I attempt suicide one more time, will I be hospitalized or will the people around me help me? I'm in so much pain."
carter_pride,46,"So many years wasted.  I still have body dysmorphia and body rumination and avoidance/depression. I usually just want to give up and stop doing things as a way of getting back against the universe or family - and it only does more harm.  They should teach all these techniques (e.g., Attention re-direction, grounding, exposure and response prevention, behavioral activation,  etc.) in high-school.  It should be a recurring and free program.  We are truly living in the dark ages.  I mean... you shouldn't have to pay an expensive shrink $300/hr to teach you this stuff.  Every kid could learn from these self-management techniques.  It's like a gym for the human mind.  I've come a long way, but there's still such a long road ahead.  Always.  Even basic things like ""sitting with the discomfort"" - it's a lifelong battle.  It's one thing to know it theoretically or intellectually - it's entirely different to master it.  The human mind/body/action pipeline connection is incredible."

rioboy1985,37,"I wonder if this is freedom?  One of my main OCD themes has been relationships, legal issues etc. I analyse so many aspects of them.  Recently, I've been single and avoiding girls. There are many reasons, but one is the stress it causes. In a relationship I'm normally questioning her the whole entire day and caught up in my OCD spiral.  Given that I've been single, I haven't had these same stresses and consequently have been much more focused on my work, future etc.  There has been this weird thing happening to me. I've felt hopeful and free. On the other hand, I've felt like, ""this is too good to be true"", ""something bad is gonna happen to take away this peace and hope I feel"" etc.   Why have I been feeling hopeful? Because I've been much more sensible with my money. I've paid off my credit card. I'm setting money aside. I'm working more. I'm able to buy the things I need and I do what I WANT to do. It's quite simply a great time in my life.  However, it's hard to be in constant peace because I'm constantly waiting for something to come and F up my life. I have 2 main thoughts- 1. This hope is how ""normal"" people feel. It's come to me as a result of my more relaxed state, my drastic reduction in rumination, and my new habits. 2. I'm trying to sabotage my own life and ruminating looking for anything bad that might take away this present time of peace and hope.  So, I wonder if this is a state I can learn to live in, a default state of peace, freedom and hope. I really do hope so. I guess I need to become even more dedicated to cut out all ruminating. Yet, this surely is a taste of what my life CAN be if I cut OCD (ruminating) out of the equation...  I'd like to know your thoughts. Anyone have an  experience similar to mine?  I'm aware that I can't avoid romantic relationships forever, but for now, it's given me time to focus on myself and better my life"

massivesmoke,49,"i know we have different causes for our anxiety, but i was wondering if you figured where did confession ocd originated from in your own special case?   i think mine started when i adopted the idea that i need to be ""real"". And act the same way in public and private. This led to me feeling like i should share everything with the whole world, my sexual feelings included (which is very weird to just say to random people tbh) and it puts a lot of stress on me, so i was just wondering where did yours originated from as i think it might help me and some people to figure out our issues."
shadowXXe,44,had a ahem wet dream sorry if thats TMI which triggered me and the cycle restarts I was on a road to recovery too it feels like im never going to escape this episode its been going on for a month it diesnt even feel like an episode anymore it no long feels like im fighting OCD it feel slike im fighting my self which is only further sinking me. OCD has ruined my life i wish i could go back in time before thiiis shitty mess happened
massivesmoke,49,"yesterday i had an immoral answer to a weird question and it has been stressing me out a lot. Now i feel like telling people about it and seek forgiveness for my immorality, or at least what i perceive to be immorality as im not sure if the answer was an intrusive thought, an answer without thinking, or actually a deep down immoral thing in me. Is this ocd in action? should i tell some people? or what!"

sharksandpickles,45,"Ocd has ruined so many fucking things in my life. My grades, my relationship with my family (anger outbursts when they interrupt my compulsions), constantly having intrusive thoughts and groinal responses and just causing harm to others. I'm tired of this. I can't stop those thoughts from coming. I say extremely rude things that I don't mean to my siblings because of it and I'm scared my little sibling sees me as dangerous and evil. I should be considered an abuser. I despise myself. Nobody outside of my family knows about my horrible past actions except my psychologist. I don't know if I can take this anymore. The only things keeping me going are my favorite shows and I'm afraid of my brother's reaction if I was gone, since he's so little. I know for a fact that everyone else would simply not care and move on with their lives."
purple07631,15,"My life is a mess because of my OCD. Do I have to suffer with this? Hello, everyone. I'm suffering from OCD and my heart hurts. I want to stop social networking and all my efforts. There is an OCD community in my country, but honestly it's not much more than this reddit group and I'm writing this with an automatic translator. It's so pathetic that I feel like crying. Because of my mental disability, my English is at a kindergarten level. Everyone else can do it perfectly, right? I will never be able to speak English perfectly or write it myself. People say I have the power of action, but I can't eat with action, I have to die. Recently, I started to draw pictures, something I have been traumatized by for a long time, but now I feel like crying. I have no confidence. People with low intelligence are looked down upon. Is it wrong to be so unintelligent? All the horrible things people say about the disabled are in Google suggestions. I didn't want to be disabled either! I wanted to be born normal, go to school, have a healthy mental health, and most importantly, be independent enough to live on my own! I never wanted to be disabled! Since I was a child, everyone has been telling me that I'm a spoiled person, but would they have said such horrible things if they knew I was disabled? I can't talk back because I'm a child. It's too painful. I want to die. I didn't want to be a handicapped person. I even want to pretend to be a tragic heroine. I'd rather die. If I died, I wouldn't have to worry about my OCD, and I wouldn't have to worry about my mental disability. Why am I so weak? Why was I born so weak? Sorry, I wrote about something other than OCD, but I didn't know where the intellectual disability community was."
massivesmoke,49,"Yesterday i had a crazy argument about my friend about how far i will go to keep my family's traditions and make my parents happy if my relationship was good with them (which is not btw). And he threw a question joking asking if i will do something (not gnna mention it here) that i see as very immoral. The only thing that popped up in my head is yes, and when i tried to later see if i truly feel that way i got different results, sometimes yes, sometimes no, sometimes confusion if i would really do that. How can iknow if its an intruive thought? is this an ocd pattern? its really stressing me out"
BBlank223,1,"since i realized it's ocd, i feel like i have no control over my own brain, it keeps sending me very bad intrusive thoughts, i used to watch criminal psychology and true crime videos on youtube, but there was one that i watched that i keep getting intrusive thoughts about, cause it was so brutal. i read fanfiction and stuff, and im reading a batman one recently, where the joker was killed and cut up and i remember that story cause of it.  im afraid of dating in general cause im afraid im gonna hurt someone.  i also get intrusive thoughts about animals, and i think i look at the private parts cause of it, i have a weird thing with looking at private parts its weird and i hate it, not just with animals with human beings too, i used to want a dog, but now i dont know cause im afraid of these thoughts.  i get sexual intrusive thoughts about my family and that also hurts me, cause i feel super numb to all these thoughts now, i think im just equally depressed.  i dont think im in control anymore and i hate it. i hate thinking im gonna harm anyone, i hate knowing that when im awake in the middle of the night and go to the kitchen the thoughts of stabbing my mom in her sleep pops up. or then stabbing myself instead, or carving my own eye balls out.  i need this to stop cause i want control over my life again, i don't want to feel depressed and hopeless anymore. i feel like a monster half of the time, i dont feel like myself at all. i dont remember know what it feels like to be okay.  i was okay before the pandemic but being stuck in a constant loop of not doing anything kills me, i applied for a job a couple of weeks ago, didn't hear back yet, i might never hear back. i need to start the ged program but i feel unmotivated.  i go to therapy on the 21st for my first actual appointment, i did the orientation and the introductory already. but i also don't know how to talk about this outloud and come to terms with the thoughts."
BBlank223,1,"I'm trying to sleep right now, and my fear of heights or any harm ocd thought keeps popping in. Like I'm physically scared of being in buildings with more than 3 floors in gear that I follow an intrusive thought and jump.  I can see the vivid dream now, cause i feel very anxious about it. Then I had a thought of a car tire running over my head. So this sucks aswell  I also had one about stabbing myself. I hate this. Cause I'm trying to relax and sleep. I havent slept at all tonight."
littledaisy_07,8,"I mean, we’re a community where everyone suffers because of the same monster. We shouldn’t ignore each other. Many people can’t get help anywhere else and a little comment can really help"
BBlank223,1,"so when i fap im usually doing it either out of boredom, compulsion or just reacting to a groinal response, those are somewhat manageable(trying nofap to stop the compulsive part). anyway what i really hate is when in the middle of it, any and every sexual intrusive thought comes flooding in, as ruminations, or like i had a weird disgusting dream about my grandmother it was an ocd dream, but like the thoughts of the dream started flooding in and i ignored it to finish, cause someone told me its better to ignore it and finish, cause it can give the thoughts more power if you stop and let it keep ruminating.  this fucking sucks cause i feel so out of control, like i have little to no control over my thoughts, and i don't. and i wish i did."
BBlank223,1,"I have been having vivid dreams but this one was the worst in a while, I apparently was dating my grandmother in this dream, I dont like it. I woke up with a groinal response aswell which made me more anxious.   I mean by the end of it I was trying to break up with her, but like why tf did this dream exist. The ocd medication gives me really vivid dreams.  How to I erase from brain? I have had dreams before about my brother raping me aswell so like, this isnt the first dream like that to happen.  I want it to stop, I want to rewire my brain."
turquoiseturtle01,5,"The 2 thieves in my neighborhood returned the beginning of last week to case/scope out the area to walk around. My anxiety and OCD has been up ever since they returned. I thought they wouldn’t show back up but no they decide to see what they can steal from houses, mail, and cars. In total from the footage of evidence from recordings on my security camera since August they have been around my neighborhood a total of 7 times which feels like harassment. I still keep having to constantly check my security cameras when I’m at home and when I go places because I worry they might target my house. The police also still have not caught these 2 thieves to arrest them, the police officer said there would be cops patrolling my street but that never happened. Plus I still keep having hallucinations when I close my eyes seeing my front yard and porch and have a hard time sleeping during the day and at night."
mavavilj,40,"How to improve on time management? It seems that I put in a lot of hours, but someone complains I take more time to complete things?  It seems as if I'm not wasting time, since I use so many hours. But perhaps it's going to wrong places?  A particular habit is e.g. having to recheck many times that everything is ""near faultless"". My psychiatrist has suggested that my quality standards may be overly high. But I have troubles adapting, because I appreciate good quality and doing less feels like ""taking shortcuts""."
BBlank223,1,"My harm ocd flares up at night time, and it comes to a point where I actually imagine going through with the thoughts, kinda like ""what would happen"" situation,  and its bugging me cause I dont want to hurt anyone, or I'll have ones toward myself. I recently started therapy.  Mostly did an introductory and my first real session is soon, I totally forgot the day, but I feel like I need these to go away first. I have so many problems I need to talk about but I'm scared of my harm ocd.  I talked to my mom about it, and while she understands I have ocd intrusive thoughts, she doesnt really understand it fully, cause she asked me if there was any truth to these thoughts. I mean I also think she might get intrusive thoughts but idk, cause she said she also got simular thoughts before.

BBlank223,1," so i have been getting intrusive thoughts about stuff recently, anyway i like watching reaction channels usually and there is this one, that i didn't watch anymore but was just subscribed. anyway i saw a video on my feed about twin brothers, who were basically kissing in the thumbnail and they were reacting to it.  i used to think i had an incest kink, but i have a weird search compulsion of incest smut and i have stopped it mostly, anyway i don't like seeing it cause it give me intrusive thoughts about my own family.  but first off why would they react to that in the first place, and then i thought it was a miosunderstanding and that they just looked alike, so i clicked the video to read comments, and it wasn't a misunderstanding.  i hate how people do and react to stuff for content. cause like it isn't their responsibility to not watch it cause of me, i don't even know them. but like why react/watch it in the first place."
sharksandpickles,45,"Ocd has ruined my life. Some of my grades have dropped, I act aggressive towards others bc I constantly get intrusive thoughts and groinal responses (and when other ppl talk they interrupt them so I keep repeating them over and over again and it's exhausting) and I'm just generally not doing well. I've been getting help for almost a year but nothing helps. Things are only getting worse. I'm a terrible person. Everything would be better if I wasn't here. I wouldn't have hurt my loved ones. Physically nor mentally. I deserve this feeling and much worse things. I don't deserve anything good. And people ask me ""What did you do?"". It's too horrible for me to say it. It really is. And I'm ashamed to say it out loud. I despise myself. I shouldn't have been born."

RockyK96,36,I’ve been so used to having basically every waking thought controlled by my OCD and a lot of what I do compulsive actions around that. Through meds and therapy i’m starting to have better days with less symptoms but now I don’t really know how to manage that. Im trying to just practice mindfulness and fill my time with being productive or looking for hobbies but it’s like my brain isn’t used to doing things just because and not out of a compulsive need to. I never thought getting better would feel this uncomfortable and empty. Can anyone else relate and is there any advice in dealing with this?
BBlank223,1,"sexual intrusive thoughts suck, so masturbation is one of my compulsions so i felt that i needed to masturbate and stuff, i had a sexual intrusive thought earlier when i was waking up(i sleep all day) i pushed it away and then ate, and then started reading, i started touching myself and then the thoughts came back full force, someone told me if i stopped it would give the thoughts more power, so i ignored them and continued.  i hate having sexual intrusive thoughts about family, they are literally the worst, i wish i can go back in time and undiscover alot of the things i discovered, cause now my brain is non stop thinking about it and it fucking sucks."

If you can't shape each person's pain, then pain isn't the same. At least I hate the people around me because of my pain. I hate the happy ones. One day I may destroy myself if I think like this, but I feel inferior because the happy ones around me are living normal lives, working and going to school, and I couldn't do it. I am miserable and lonely. I am troubled by the fear of harming those around me one day. I don't want to be a criminal. I don't want to be a criminal, at least not a sensible one, and I don't want to be a criminal, but I do want to kill people and wish they would die. Have any of you here ever felt jealous of the happiness of those around you, or felt the urge to kill? Do these thoughts make you feel anxious? Have you been able to get over it? I'm still fighting with myself today. I can't cry these days. I want to talk a lot to the people around me, but I can't because I'm afraid of their reaction. I'm afraid of their reaction. I'm afraid of the reaction. But I don't have the courage to die. Is it true that 10 seconds before you commit suicide, you always regret it? Why is my life so hard and painful when there is no one in this world who is unnecessary? I don't believe in someday. There are people who don't believe in someday and will die soon. I am sick of living my life knowing that I may not be rewarded one day. But I don't have the courage to die. At any rate, I am living somehow. But there are times when it's really hard to live. What should I do?"

BBlank223,1,"So I recently been obsession over how I walk, idk if it is apart of tocd, but i think it fits here aswell. Anyway what happens is I notice people walked differently male and female meaning, anyway I think my body movement in general is abit feminine it probably isnt, but for some reason I get intrusive thoughts about it.  I also think I walk more femininity, but I also think I walk normal. I have been looking up how to walk videos on youtube, what I mean by walk more femininely, I don't strut or move my hips, I just notice that guys in tv shows walk abit differently then I do.  Like they have abit more shoulder movement. I hate having to question all this cause it physically makes me abit anxious. How do I get the shoulder movement. How do I move upper body like that.  I also blame my maladaptive daydreaming, aka making up scenarios, cause i usually make up stories for both male and female characters and i act them out usually. And i think walking was apart of it.   Anyway i apparently need to figure out how to walk cause i have a stiff upper body when i do. My legs and arms are the only things that move when i walk. I also read that you should swing your arms from your shoulder but idk how."
turquoiseturtle01,5,"When I close my eyes when I rest and sleep I see the outline images of my porch and front yard even though I’m not outside. This has been happening since August when I kept checking my security camera because of the thieves in my neighborhood. I think it might be from checking too much that it’s kept those detail images in my mind and eyesight. These images have been keeping me from sleeping, even when I try to put a pitch black eye mask over my eyes I still see those porch and front yard images. Would this be considered a closed eye hallucination and are closed eye hallucinations connected to OCD?"
turquoiseturtle01,5,I have been struggling with paranoia & OCD since August because theft has been happening in my neighborhood. 3 thieves keep trying to steal mail/packages and break into cars on my street. They keep casing/scoping out the area by walking around early in the morning around 5-6 a.m. trying to see who is and isn’t at home to see what things they can get into to steal. I have been constantly checking my security cameras and screen recording the security camera videos and photos as evidence. I keep waking up early in the morning to check and I have also been having trouble sleeping at night because of how concerned I am about the thieves in my neighborhood. I have also been email the police officer with the evidence for it to be pieced together. Those thieves took a break from casing my neighborhood for 3 weeks but now they have returned back to my area in September. They still have not been caught and arrested by the police. Their theft has been going on in other areas of my town since May and they are still wanted.
turquoiseturtle01,5,"A few days ago I was doing homework on my laptop and was going to put on a pair of blue light glasses. This pair I put on was new and haven’t worn it. I cleaned and wiped  it carefully with glasses cleaning wipes and a microfiber cloth. After I finished using them, from the light from a lamp in my room I noticed a small scratch on the side of the lens. I started to panic and cry because I was careful not to let my fingernails touch the lens, especially since it’s new glasses. I gave into the compulsion unfortunately of trying to clean up the area where the small scratch is with a glasses wood but the scratch still wouldn’t go away. I ended up putting the glasses away back in its case because I didn’t want the scratch to get in the way of my vision while wearing them. I am now deciding if I should still keep that specific pair of glasses, donate them to a thrift store, or get an exact replacement pair from the store that doesn’t have any scratches."
DangerousFee4,38,I need some open discussion about this. I have a fear poeple can read ny mind and vibe while hanging out with them long enough.  Ive seen recently on titkok the intuition challenge where the person claps at the same time their friend does. I have a feeling poeple can read your mind and enegery. They can gather information about you and your behaviors based of your compulsions and thoughts.   I believe if you hang out with someone long enough you can start to read them.   Let me know what your opinions on this is.
tgott1686,28,Did anybody see continued improvement on anafranil after 12 weeks?
Right_now78,41,"my guilt literally transforms into physical pain in the form of heart palpitations, stomach pain and extreme fatigue,  i literally feel guilty and responsable for my family/ friends/ partner's problems, i have to stop the harm from occuring and if it does, it my fucking fault , i didn't do enough to stop it from occuring, i am a repulsive narcissist, i only think about myself, "" the only solution to get rid of this guilt is to DIE"" said OCD"
Sommet_,22,"Me and friends were at the table playing card games. As we started cleaning up, I think I accidentally drank from my friends drink. It’s likely mine since I believe I had mine to the left side of me and theirs were on the right. I literally drank a big sip and realized. So I ended up dumping both of our water bottles away. Will I catch something? I don’t want a disease or such."
BBlank223,1,"Last time I was in therapy it was just for anxiety, so I'm kinda nervous to talk about all the intrusive thoughts and stuff, but I also wanna talk about my trauma, but recently I been struggling with pocd, and I dont think I want to talk about that in the first session tbh, or my tocd which I also dont think I want to talk about in the first one. Mostly cause idk of I can trust the person fully, cause when I went to orientation I talked to a different person then they set me up with the therapist. And I havent met her yet.  I could talk about my harm ocd cause i kinda already mentioned it in Orientation. And to my med management doctor cause he prescribed medicine for my intrusive thought and compulsions.  I should also talk about my sexual intrusive thoughts. But I dont feel comfortable talking about that first, I guess I'm over thinking therapy tbh, but like. What if im told that im actually crazy? Its giving me anxiety.  Like I dont feel suicidal, but I have been having intrusive thoughts about jumping off a building, or stabbing myself. Or I get intrusive thoughts about hurting other people. Those are the worst.  I'm mostly nervous about pocd cause I never really talked about those problems outloud to someone. My mom knows about alot of the other things, even though I felt anxious telling her. I dont think she fully understands tbh though.  Or i could talk about the communication problems i was having, still having. But like i dont think she can really help me with that part, cause i feel like i just dont know how to talk to people. That i basically just ran out of words, and idk if that's just some mental problem or just that I'm stupid and dont know grammer and vocabulary.  Anyway I'm gonna try and be positive about it, but like. I'm really anxious."
shadowXXe,44,i feel like im making this post in vain. i feel like i know the answer but i'll ask anyway. How do i stop these intrusive thoughts. Usually my OCD episodes last a week a most this has dragged on for two damn weeks the depression is gone but the intrusive thoughts are still there. i cant do alot of things i liked doing before. i feel like its almost normal now these thoughts its almost like they have become me if i stay away from certain things the thoguths dont happen that much but i dont want to stay away from things I JUST WANT TO BE NORMAL AGAIN I want my hobbies back i want my relationships back I want my self back if i could kick OCD out of me and curb stomp it i would

purple07631,15,"I hadn't received a reply from the person I had been exchanging e-mails with for a while, so I sent two e-mails to him saying that I was worried about him. I was so curious that I sent them. I'm sure they'll think I'm a pushy person. I can't sleep because I'm filled with regret about why I sent them. I want to go to sleep, but I'm so anxious and worried. Can someone please help me? I know it's my fault, but I'm worried that even if I wait, I won't get a reply from that side. I'm too anxious to know what to do if I get a reply, and I'm getting furiously hungry. It's midnight in my country and I need to sleep. What should I do? I'm sorry if this post has nothing to do with OCD."
shadowXXe,44,yep. tried to fight through on of my triggers and know i feel exactly like i did at the start of this viscious cycle fuck me i should have just avoided it now im goign to have to prepare for another week of mental anguish i thought this was going to stop the trigger from being a trigger now im just back to square one
purple07631,15,"This may be a post that has nothing to do with OCD. First of all, I apologize. I'm sorry. I have a body type that needs to lose weight, but I don't want to lose weight. I think I might have a phobia of men. I'm so scared that if I lose weight, men will come to me. I want to lose weight. I want to lose weight, but I don't want to be around people who do. My parents, who have lost a lot of weight, say that everyone around them asks them what they should do to lose weight. I don't want to lose weight for beauty, I want to lose weight for health. I don't want to be influenced by the people around me to lose weight. But people definitely think I'm fat. Yes, I am obese. And I am severely obese. I hate it when I think about the people around me. I hate the people around me so much that I feel like I'm going to lash out impulsively. Why has it become the trend to lose weight for beauty's sake? On the other hand, if I stay fat like this, I think it will hinder me in many ways. I want to lose weight for my own sake, but it's because I'm weak-minded. I hate the people around me. I hate people. I hate myself for being so self-conscious. Every time I look at my parents, I have negative thoughts about why and how I can't lose weight. Sometimes I feel hopeless. They also tell me to lose weight. I guess everyone likes me better when I'm thin, and I guess I'm not worthy of being fat. In addition to my OCD, I also have body shape issues that are killing me. Please help me. I am afraid to sleep at night even though I can sleep during the day. If I want to die someday, I will do it with lots of pills and lots of alcoholic drinks. Even if I can't die, I hope I can erase my memory."
pleaseimconfused,21,"hi. i’m 18f and i recently moved away for college. i started developing this intense fear that i’m constantly being watched and even though i shut my windows i’m living in this weird fantasy headspace where i’m being monitored 24/7 and i sometimes do things which i’m scared are indecent and the “aerial” viewpoint that is following me around is recording it all and that children and just others in general are watching and listening in  this sounds really weird but whenever i walk or move at all i have these urges to move in ways that aren’t sexual but my brain says they are and then i’m reminded that i’m being watched and i don’t want to hurt anyone.  like for instance i was lying on my bed which is next to the windows but i have them shut and the blinds are closed except for a small sliver all the way on top to let light in. i did this so no one can see me and so i can’t see anyone.    here’s what i did that’s making me paranoid:  i was biting my nail and lying on my bed and then i got this thought that if someone’s watching me and i moved my arm it would look sexual (i was fully clothed) but for some reason i moved my arm anyways (partially because it was more comfortable second i think i might have been testing myself). i know no one was watching me because i had my windows shut but in my head it happened so now i’m in a rumination loop. like i’m not sure why i acted on it, in my head i got this fear and then i acted it out but in a way where i wanted to seem like i had composure and control and the whole time i was looking at myself from a birds eye view and i’m scared.   i don’t know if i’m the villain or if i’m the victim of my mind. like first i should feel safe in my home but then why did i act on a thought ?  my old therapist was saying i might be having a psychotic break which idk how to process   EDIT: in a sense a lot of my ocd situations are caused by the fact that in my head all these situations are happening and i can’t separate it from what might be real. like i’m fully convinced that someone may be watching me and no matter how much i try laughing it off it keeps getting worse."

BBlank223,1,"so i used to read fanfiction smut, i read some dark stuff,when i read the darker stuff it was mostly that i accidentally came across it. skimmed it once, then re read it twice more, this happened atleast 10ish times that i remember. my more ""normal"" stuff that i read, the reason i put normal in quotaions is cause it wasnt that normal. the reason i have a problem and think this is real event ocd, is cause it ties in with all the intrusive thoughts i get now and some of my ocd problems. like sexual thoughts about family, pocd etc.  my more normal stuff was still abit taboo.  i wasnt even into the actual characters or really imagined what the person was writing, it was the description of sex that i was fapping to, even thought i dont think i was ever really aroused. i realized masturbating is one of my weirdest obsessions. so i dont know if i feel aroused most of the time i actually do masturbate. i do think alot of the time it was me reacting to a gronial response aswell cause i didn't know what that was until recently and always thought i was just horny. but i wasn't  i don't want to go into much more detail cause im still abit confused about all this stuff and im still learning stuff about my ocd day to day. but like i don't know if i truly am a monster for reading the darker shit tbh. anyway im gonna try an be positive. have a nice day."

littledaisy_07,8,My hands feel filthy despite washing them 3 times and the whole time using the computer was just awful. I’m fed up. My contamination OCD is way too high and I don’t know how to deal with it
BBlank223,1,"I have communication problems, I think I dont have a broad vocabulary. There are times where I know what I want to say but it wont come out. Or that I want to talk but I cant, and I cant even think of what to talk about with my own mother. I have been having ruminations about these problems and looked up to see what it is, I think it's a mix of adhd and ocd. I recently saw a video that outlined what I think is the problem.  I'm so used to not talking to people, I have 1 friend(online) and I isolate myself in my room cause it's my comfort zone, I do talk to my mom the most, the one friend I have is just typing conversations. And it's been almost 3 years since I have really been in a proper social setting that wasn't a doctors office.  What the video said was I learnt theblanguage of technology and my brain started to forget how to communicate outside of that properly, which in all honesty I already knew. But the way they explained it was like, I did forget an actual language. Even though I didnt it was just speaking aloud.  Idk what's wrong fully and I have been having a crisis about it cause, I wanna make more friends, and start dating and doing normal stuff outside of the house. But like.... how can I do that if I dont know how to communicate or what to talk about.   I also have a fear of being unintelligible. Cause I do think I forget words or mumble or that I gave a stutter sometimes. That people cant understand me. Is there anyway to stop the ruminations about this?"
turquoiseturtle01,5,"These past few days I’ve been triggered again by things that have scratches on them like some cups, a laptop case, and reading glasses. If start to use them again and ignore the scratches, is considered exposure to reduce the anxiety/triggers of scratches?"
NameIntrepid,9,I can’t feel myself at all. I feel so detached and disconnected.. My mind keeps creating these very delusional thoughts that literally don’t make any sense at all. It’ll be like ‘that dude over there is looking at you or has a reason for it’. Just really weird and random shit like that and I’m like wtf is even going on anymore.
turquoiseturtle01,5,I noticed a scratch on my favorite Hydroflask water bottle and I don’t know how it got there. I started to get anxiety because I don’t know what caused the scratches and it’s noticeable. I also have this unusual paint chipping and scratch on my MacBook Air. That chipping and scratch wasn’t there before. I think it might’ve been from one of the workers who was installing a new anti virus software from Best Buy when they were handling the laptop. I’m getting so annoyed and triggered by scratches and paint chipping. I just wish those weren’t there so I wouldn’t have this anxiety about noticing small things. I guess this is because since I’m so careful and try to keep the things I own in good condition.

DangerousFee4,38,"Imagine paying thousands of dollars in medical bills each year to see doctors cause your brain is telling you fucked up shit all day every day. Basically running your every move and you literally can't do anything about it.  It effects your behaviors, mood, thoughts, emotions. Basically deeming you disabled.   No wonder why 98% of people with ocd have extremely low levels of self esteem and confindence. Imgaine not having a identity and can hardly form a opinion. Lose your sense of values and morals.   Why is this illness even a thing?"

shadowXXe,44,It's been so long since I felt normal. You know at this point I'm just willing to accept that in fucked up and that it's not OCD because it really feels like that. Maybe I can help others avoid the same.

turquoiseturtle01,5,"Not too long ago I used to order things from selling websites like EBay, Depop, Mercari, Poshmark, and Etsy. After some recent events of having constant obsessive thoughts of order from those websites, I got too tired to use them and deactivated all those accounts. Whenever I look up other things unrelated to orders on the Google app, those selling websites still show up in the Google search results and Google images. It really triggers me when those websites still show up because then I start imagine those websites in my head and brings back bad memories of being scammed from some experiences. It’s so hard for me to come across when they are advertised because I don’t want to constantly look on those selling websites. Is there any settings on the Google app where it blocks certain websites like that from showing up on search results and images? I’m just trying not to give into those compulsions of going on those types of websites because then that’s all I think about."
shadowXXe,44,everytime i try to it makes me feel like i believe them.  i dotn want to they are so disgusting i don't want to be that person thats the wjhjole reason im depressed i just dont want the thoughts to be real but they feel so real i cant even tell if they aren't i'm tired of figthing but i dont want to give in aswell

BBlank223,1,"So i make up scenarios in my head, and in all honesty it wold be fine if i only did it for myself like what i do for myself is, running trhough how i think certain conversations would go, some ambitions i want to do, maybe some celebrities/youtubers i want to talk to. cause i have no friends, and i have no friends. that makes me seem kina crazy XD im no i swear, i know i'll never actually talk or be friends and i have no intention to do anything crazy like stalking.  but then i also make up scenarios for celebrities and tv show charaters like if im not satisfied with a certain ending of an episode in my head ill re make it and then make it different even though the next episode fixes what i have a problem with, or i fancast a certain celebrity as a character and imagine them in tv shows like the flash or arrow any superhero show. its a weird obsession, but idk if im just crazy, or not.  cause when i just obsess over certain things of my future or if i played with my favorite streamers or i acted in a tv show thats fine, but making up scenarios for other people is kinda crazy.  i dont even realy like the ones about myself to much the only ones im okay with is ones i plan for stuff i want to do in the future. cause i did have ambition for streaming, but now i don't know, maybe some of those thoughts came from the ambitions, like maybe me obsession over my future made me obsess over thoughts about it. am i trying to convience myself i'm not crazy?"
turquoiseturtle01,5,Today I was drinking my coffee and noticed the pattern design painted on is chipping off. I was disappointed because I got it last year and am very careful washing and drinking from it. I am nervous now that the images of the paint chipping from the cup will stay in my mind and get obsessive thoughts. Should I leave the chipping on the cup as it is as a type of exposure or rub off the paint design?

shadowXXe,44,"I'm probably going to get a UTI but I can't help it everytime go to pee I get overwhelmed by this feeling of guilt, shame and disgust because it's too similar to another activity."
shadowXXe,44,I'm just having trouble distinguishing reality from OCD here. Can OCD produce intrusive emotions? At times it almost feels like it's nearly convinced me to do something. Is thi even IOCD or am I just actual human filth
massivesmoke,49,"\*\*\*IMPORTANT\*\*\* this isnt a Pedo ocd post. But more of a general obsession i have which is the fear that i am a sociopath or a bad person for not feeling shitloads of compassion and sadness about some things   &#x200B;  today i remembered a bad thing i did when i was 13, my friend was like 11 or 10 back then but looked much older (he looked like 13). I was a kid, i didnt know what i was doing and i played with him in a way that i touched him. I didnt know what i was doing, i thought its normal, i thought its not a bad thing but normal thing, probably i didnt even understand the whole thing probably. I kinda dragged him into this game that allowed me to touch him, but i didnt think of it as rape, more like teasing him or something stupid. but in my defense i seriously had no fucking idea what i was doing and was driven by my hormones.   i feel guilty about it, but when i look deep down in me im kinda seeing that i feel guilty or ashamed because im afraid of the rejection i will face if i tell this to people, and not because i feel bad about what i have done.   i am not a pedophile, i dont think the act is ok, i dont find any sexual thing related to minors interesting or justifiable. But i really didnt know what im doing.   i feel guilty about it, i shouldnt do it. Also, it didnt seemingly harm my friend as we are still friends, and he never mentioned it and our friendship didnt change at all after that happened. I think he didnt even understand wat was happening.   i feel like im a bad person, i should feel very bad about what i did and im not sure if i do. Maybe because i see myself as dumb back then and know that i didnt have evil intentions but just a teenager with poor judgement? but does that make me immoral? am i a child abuser? i feel like i should be in jail, like i should be considered a sex offender. I feel im such a bad person for seemingly not feeling i did anything horirble. I take full responsibility of the thing i did, but why am i not feeling horrible about it?   like yes fuck me! i did a very fucked up thing because of how stupid i was, but i didnt have bad intentions! teenagers are fucking idiots all the time and dont realize most of the shit they do.   am i a bad person? wtf should i feel or think or do? what the fuck am i now?   OR IS ALL OF THIS CONFUSION a trick created by my ocd? because i see this as something like a self sabotage (which is what ocd can be most of the time). As if im looking for a way to fuck myself up, if i feel guilty i try to find a way to make myself a bette rperson and redeem myself, but once i dont feel guilty i feel horrible for not feeling guilty, u see the pattern?   please help me"

shadowXXe,44,"I recently left school for college. The thing is my college days are only 3 days per week. And I've had a lot of free time due to that.

I noticed the same thing in lockdown last year I've never had a breakdown until last month then I had two days apart and now I'm at an all time low depressed, missing the past, the words I hate myself repeating in my mind.

I was always someone who supports women rights, and hates the idea of having a lot sexual relationships for the sake of pleasure as i see sex as something that shouldnt be done just for the ske of having pleasure. Now i question if i am ok with everything and worry as hell if i dont get an inner response that supports what i see is right. I question everything, do i feel ok about women being beaten? do i feel ok about men controling their women? if i see one scene in a movie where a man hits a woman or soemthing i freak out fearing if i am ok with such thing or if i justify it. im scared. Im scared that i am ok wth such things, is this ocd? or is it another anxiety issue?"

I also have weird thoughts about the devil, and that’s weird because I am an atheist, but for the longest time I was convinced that my childhood Faustian pact would bring me wealth and success.

mavavilj,40,"It seems that upping serotonin is not all there is, but it's about ""balance"". So I wonder if there's some particular combination/structure that's useful for that balance?  I've found for example that pairing certain vitamins with tryptophan while also adding fast carbs is a combo, but it also has to be spread out during the day in reasonable ways or otherwise the balance will not be constant throughout the day. Similarly it's not enough to simply ""consume a lot of serotonin-foods"", because I've found that when you take too much of them, then the effectiveness fades or turns into more manic effects or sometimes sleepy effects.  Then I've pondered, whether some foods, combos or some habits (like Pomodoro work technique) are more effective for managing that balance, w/o overdoing it or underdoing it.  Even for example increasing exercise doesn't work out, because too much and you start to burn yourself out, rather than enhance. Exercise seems pretty good at balancing, but then you need to limit it to an appropriate level (i.e. not too intense). (some support: [https://culinahealth.com/2020/07/31/how-much-exercise-is-too-much/](https://culinahealth.com/2020/07/31/how-much-exercise-is-too-much/))  Something which is also pretty good at balance is to cut down stress. Cut down work hours. But again if you overdo this, it may lead to depressive symptoms."

This morning, when I woke up with morning wood I wanted to touch myself but then the ruminations started kicking back in and I kept getting anxious, masterbation is one of my compulsions aswell, I'm trying nofap to get rid of that compulsion, I held off for 3ish hours before I gave into the compulsion, but the ruminations were still there even though I wasn't thinking about the person or situation,  and trying to get rid of the thoughts as well.  Ruminations fucking suck cause afterwards I felt calm till the intrusive thoughts came in telling me I was a monster for jerking off while knowing someone died. I didnt even want to either.

SlipInternational593,47,it is over. I watched the latest episode of a variety show which touches on murder and it honestly triggered me because of the extremely unsettling coincidences with my harm and false memory. Is this God telling me that my fears are true? I don't think I can live on any longer... it is too much. I do think I have the worst OCD and no one has it worse than me. I don't even know myself anymore. Maybe I'm a murderer. Period.

For example i obsess over how i’m perceived, and it’s very possible my fear of being perceived as a bitch is real and someone in the world is doing it, we always talk about how OCD is so irrational but what do we do when it’s actually not?

To avoid intrusive thoughts and groinal responses, I tried distracting myself by using my phone. I spent time on the internet for the most of the day. I got told to distract myself from my thoughts. It was a really bad mistake. Some of my grades have dropped. And by some I mean most. I wasted a fucking year. It's also because of the stupid fear of being judged and it makes me wanna punch myself. Now I have only this year left to try to get better grades. Fucking hate it here. Fuck everything."
turquoiseturtle01,5,"I noticed when I exercise, I see cartoon characters on the side of my vision. Like when I exercise I’ll start to see images of cartoon characters. A few months ago when I was exercising at the corner of my vision I would see Lola Bunny from Space Jam. Today while I was exercising I saw Luca from the Pixar movie. I think this might be from thinking about wanting to watch cartoon movies which leads to me having images in my head because I memorize what the cartoon characters look like. Is this common for OCD or is this possibly an opened/closed eye hallucination?"
turquoiseturtle01,5,Yesterday I was taking a shower and listening to music. Randomly I started thinking about a rainbow striped shirt I used to have a few years ago. I remember having to donate it because it didn’t fit me anymore and I’m starting to miss it. While I was showering my mind and vision kept picturing how the shirt looked and how I wish the shirt would’ve fit better. From this overthinking  my head feels tingly and achy.
turquoiseturtle01,5,Last night I was having a regular night sleeping. I don’t remember much about my dream but towards the early morning one of my new obsessions invaded it. I saw in my mind images of some striped shirts I’ve been wanting from the store. Those images of the shirts were stuck in my vision and mind while I was dreaming. I woke up early and those images of my new obsession of the striped shirts were still in my mind when I opened my eyes. My head is also feeling achy and tingling because my mind can’t stop thinking about it. I thought my mind was taking a break from obsessions but randomly new obsessions keep coming.

sharksandpickles,45,"I have this compulsion where I use plenty of soap when I wash my hands and the bottle gets empty really quickly because of how much I waste it. My parents (who don't wash their hands) complain about it almost everyday but don't know that it's because of OCD. I haven't told them the reason because it's useless trying to talk to them about my mental health. They never listen, it's like there's no way their kids can be mentally ill. My mom barely even talks to me unless there's something for her to complain about. Sometimes it doesn't even feel like I'm their child. Her constantly yelling and talking to herself makes it more difficult for me to do my compulsions and concentrate on them, especially mental compulsions and it makes me so mad I want to bite myself and rip my hair off.

pleaseimconfused,21,"hello! im 17f (I turn 18 soon) and diagnosed with ocd. my strongest theme is a mix of somatic and pocd. I have fears of walking and talking around children or my sister who is 14 because I'm scared ill accidentally appear sexual. I have to have my door shut at all times and locked and I even have difficulties breathing. I also want all my windows closed when its possible because I fear some child will see me and ill do something inappropriate to them.  &#x200B;  however I am scared I acted on my negative thought even though it didn't hurt anyone. am I an evil person?  basically I was in my (well, I share a room with my mom) room, the door was mostly closed, and I was on the far end away from where my sisters room is in the same hall. I was sitting and adjusted myself in a position where usually id be really uncomfortable because I would be afraid I accidentally incidecently exposed someone (it is a normal position, I was just laying on my stomach) but I told myself I was not doing it for that and that no one was even in the room. then I got the sudden urge to yawn (I had also just woken up) and suddenly while I was trying to get the yawn out I got what was probably an intrusive thought about ""what if my sister can hear"" and I think I acted on it to test myself because my yawn sounded weird but my yawn didnt even properly come out, it sounded more like a gasp but thankfully it wasn't loud. im not even attracted to her, and I also knew deep down no one would be able to hear me because it was quiet and I was far from where she was. and right after I didnt feel terrible at first because I knew no one could hear me but then I wondered why I yawned in a. ""strange"" sounding manner and why everything moved so quickly.  &#x200B;  im very cautious around my sister and I don't like letting her hug me anymore and avoid her most of the time because of my thoughts, but im scared, why did I have such an impulse thought and why did I act on it? was it because subconsciously I knew it wouldn't actually result in harm? am I a horrible person?? I feel really disgusted and ashamed and after that happened I had to keep testing myself to make sure no one would have heard anything.  EDIT: I noticed before my OCD I wouldn't even question these things, nor would I find a lot of stuff that is innocent to be bad even. my issue is that I read about intentions and acting on things and I feel like everything I do is now inherently contaminated and bad, so I have to isolate myself and be away from everyone. I feel like im getting ""worse"" in the sense that now small things are equivalent to big horrible things, so im worried about my actions more than whether I have attraction to kids. I know for sure im attracted to adults but my main fear is acting inappropriately "

turquoiseturtle01,5,"A few weeks ago my neighborhood experienced theft from a young man and lady stealing mail and trying to check cars. My next door neighbor had some important mail stolen and the young man and lady shot 2 pellets through my neighbor’s window. My mom informed me about everything that was happening in the neighborhood and it ended up causing me to be paranoid and have obsessive thoughts and images in my mind.  I have been having a hard time resting during the day and night. I would constantly watch my driveway and porch security cameras from the alarm app from my phone. I would wake up really  early in the mornings just to check on the cameras to make sure no thieves or other dangerous people were in my neighborhood. A few times I did see that young man and lady walking past my house trying to scope out the neighborhood to see which neighbors were and weren’t at home. I panicked seeing those people on the camera and I showed my mom the recordings and photos.   My mind kept have thoughts about what if those two thieves try coming back to target my house. I was worried they could try to figure out how to break into my backyard to get to the shed to take valuable things my family saved from memories. I had worrisome thoughts on how secure the alarms were in my house and if they’d try to steal our electronics and food. Too much of those obsessive thoughts lead me to also have closed eye hallucinations of the front yard and porch. Every time I would closed my eyes, I would see the outline of those images and it was hard to get them out because of how constantly I would check the security cameras.   I even had a scary nightmare regarding theft. I dreamt I was playing in the backyard with my dogs and all of a sudden a bunch of random thieves starting stealing from the the shed. Also in the dream, the thieves tried to take one of my dogs. I woke up from my nightmare crying and went to my mom for comfort.  My next door neighbor did call my mom letting her know that she reported those thieves to the police. Police did arrive but they couldn’t find the young man and lady. The officer interview led my mom and I and also said that cops would be doing patrols during the day and night around my neighborhood. The officer also gave us a card with the emergency dispatch phone number and report case number with the officer’s email. I did email the officer with the footage and images from when the thieves were on my neighborhood a few times early in the morning.   On my phone,  I also downloaded the Ring app but ended up deleting it because it was causing me too much anxiety reading and seeing videos about crime in my area. After a few weeks, the young lady and man haven’t been seen in my neighborhood. I checked my cameras and they weren’t seen early in the mornings and nights walking down my street. My mom and I think they might’ve been caught by the police or got bored of my neighborhood. My mom and I are still being alert by not going too many places, making sure doors and windows are locked, lights on, alarms and security cameras set, and an extra car parked in the driveway. I am also  practicing not to be paranoid by keeping myself busy with chores and hobbies at home."

A few times I didn’t receive orders because they either got lost in the mail or the sellers made up excuses. I was able to get refunds. From those past experiences, I’ve deactivated my EBay account because it was getting too repetitive and annoying of going through phases of buying on their, plus also so I wouldn’t get scammed. Plus some of the images of things I wanted to buy would stay in my head, especially the stock photos.   Every time I hear something about eBay I get annoyed. Like if I’m googling images, sometimes I see pictures sellers from eBay post and I just automatically scroll past and just wish there was a way to block EBay from Google so that it doesn’t tempt me. I still haven’t used eBay since because of how triggering it can be."

BBlank223,1,"so i usually read smut whenever i masturbate, i usually start out with stuff i want to look at and am slightly okay looking at, shouldn't anyway(Trying nofap). anyway i dont even think im usually aroused whenever i get urges to masturbate, and then while in the middle of reading the smuts, the weirder sexual obsessions kick in which makes me look at slightly more taboo stuff and im slightly going numb, and i think ill never be normal. which sucks. i had somewhat of a good day yesterday tho.  i got evaluated for therapy and i go next month for my first appointment. so good news on that, i feel uncomfortable talking about my ocd out loud in all honesty cause when i have tried to explain some parts to my mom(TOCD, Harm OCD, and Sexual Intrusive Thoughts), she didn't seem to understand fully, and while she was supportive about it, i could tell she was slightly frustrated aswell. cause my family has been having alot of mental health problems during and cause of the pandemic, and being locked up.  so i don't know how to talk about it in therapy, i feel like i would rather start with my depression and anxiety, plus they did say in the evaluation they would teach me thought stopping techniques. so those might be helpful. the evaluation only got through the bare minimum of all my problems. i felt the need to let this all out, sorry for the rant. have a nice day"

Right_now78,41,"Addiction sometimes has to do with a lack of impulse control, but this is not exclusively the inability to resist impulses. In fact, people who are too rigid with managing their impulses may also end up using substances as a manifestation of an obsessive-compulsive behavior pattern. In fact, addiction often becomes a compulsion to use the substance based on a habit that has formed over time rather than a single impulse to try something new.  In this way, people with intense focus and habitual behaviors may be as likely to develop addiction as those who are unable to control impulses. The obsession with using psychoactive drugs is a main symptom of the disorder, and it can exist both separate from and in concert with a lack of impulse control that can also be a hallmark of addiction."

I got turned on when my fav character (who I had a small crush on) grasped the other guy's hand and kissed him. At the same time I felt uncomfortable because I didn't wanna like fetishize them and I avoided looking at the other guy. I self-inserted myself in it in my head. But I still feel horrible about it. I even took two screenshots of it, zooming on the character I had a crush on. I deleted them almost right after because I felt horrible and I didn't wanna fetishize gay people. I don't remember it well but I only read a few pages properly, not the whole thing because I obviously felt uncomfortable looking at others having sex. I've always hated fujoshis. But the thing is, I have seen gay fanart of my favorite characters but self-inserted myself?? So how does that make me any different from fujoshis? I know I'm not a cis girl but I feel gross either way. I don't wanna be one of those ""yaoi uwu!!"" people. I don't get turned on by gay people kissing or anything like that just because they're gay or something like that. I don't see them as sexual objects. But I still feel like a horrible person. Am I a fujoshi? Am I fetishizing gay people? I've been thinking about this for months. I know asking for help like this isn't the best but I don't feel comfortable asking other people irl this. I don't want them to hate me."

littledaisy_07,8,"Hi. I’m studying to become a teacher and I’m going back to school on Sep. 14th. A lot of my OCD subtypes include perfectionism and therefore, school can be extremely tied with and impacted by anxiety, pressure and stress. I’m really worried about going back as I know it will make things worse and I’ll probably lose a lot of sleep and time due to my compulsions. However, I feel like holidays are extremely draining. I’m stuck with my thoughts all day and feel unable to leave my house. I miss being active and moving despite feeling less exhausted. How can I be prepared for this knowing I’m both excited and terrified to go back as far as OCD is concerned?"

BBlank223,1,"so i made a bumble thingy, i was only on there for friends and stuff, but i realized i kinda was open to dating aswell, so i remade my profile for the third time, and made it so i was on the date part, mostly on there to find people to chat and play video games with, not really interested in anything to serious, and i don't really want to meet up.  anyway i also made a grindr for the same purpose, but that part was alittle toxic, cause i need to block almost everyone who way to old, cause i find it abit uncomfortable.  anyway i made an aqquantice on both, one left me on read, which is fine.  anyway i matched on bumble with someone who has the same name as one of my cousins, which led to intrusive thoughts about the thinking its weird.  i kinda pushed it aside cause i wasnt looking for anything serious anyway, mostly friendship.  anyway fast forward to later, like 9ish hours. we kinda stopped talking(messaging) for now, we didn't really talk much anyway,  really just the basics about tv shows, and video games, and stuff.  anyway after we were done talking, i decided to read fanfic, which led to me reading smut, which led to me reading topics that i didn't want to read.  i read one where they aged a character up, which i feel guilty about. i also read one with slight incest, which i didn't want to read either. then it led to intrusive thoughts about my brother, which i have unresovled and repressed trauma cause of him, which makes me feel anxious around him, which also fuels some of the thoughts in my opinion.  not interested in any family members, i just need to calm my mind and remember that it was all fictional writing, and it had noting to do with me.  i need some advice cause in all honesty, i feel numb, and damaged, and i cant talk to a therapist, cause im supposed to get evaluated next monday then get a therapy appointment.  what do i do?"

BBlank223,1,"so i made one to make friends, which in all honesty people are kinda looking for life long friendships, while i was looking for a more causal, lets play video games together  on pc frienship, anyway it then lead to when i was swiping thinking about dating in general, which im slightly open to, but i already deleted my account twice cause i feel like friendships on the app are goign to be to diffacult for me.  i decided i'll make another on later anyway, for both things, but then i decided out of compulsion to download grindr, kinda want to make friends there, and you can, and im slightly traumatized from the last time i downloaded it cause someone asked be to do a really disgusting think with poop and then i noped out, but it also seems like people older than me want to chat, i also did the whold send nudes thing out of compulsion and i kinda regret it cause you cant change that. and one person already sent me nudes, and i dont want that.  anyway all in all im a dumbass and shouldn't have done it but once the thought popped up i just downloaded it and then mastuarbated to other profiles, which is creepy and i feel awful, i only want a friendship at least and maybe a no labeled relationship, im not ready for anything to seriously and im definantly not ready for sex in general.   i feel like im doing everything wrong."

The thoughts that have come with the last time i watched true crime, are the worst cause it's not really about me hurting anyone, its thinking about the vast and what happened.  One of the worst times to think about it is when pleasuring self, cause I can push them away easily during that, but it's still ruminating. Then my thoughts after are basically telling me I was into it, and then when I think of sex in general it makes me scared cause some harm ocd thoughts come through about me hurting someone.

Anyway i kinda left reddit for the night,cause i was browsing other subreddits and there was another time this happened aswell, so I then decided to read fanfiction.  There was a smut I was reading and it kinda gave me  an erection, which is the worst thing when you are having ruminations about anything in general, I read it in full but didn't jerk off cause I knew I'd feel worse after.  Non of the smut I read had to do with children, but my thoughts were like your getting hard at the thought of children which I wasn't. At most the problem was that they were teenagers in a tv show but the actors are well above 20 years old.  I feel so guilty and ashamed of reading that, the rumination is terrible.  I think I'm starting to get better mentally, cause of medications, but one intrusive thought can just turn my whole mood around.  And I hate it."
RockyK96,36,For example if you’re posing compulsively for validation or reassurance and realize it should you leave it up or delete it? I ask because I could see deleting becoming a part of the compulsive ritual but having it up could be feeding into the OCD as well!

BBlank223,1,"so i woke up pleasuring myself, so i decided to keep going out of boredom i don't know, i was having intrusive thoughts/dreams before i fell asleep. i kinda forgot about it when i woke up, just a bit. but then a new theme came in while i was doing it. so i used to watch true crime, i don't think its to healthy for my mental health right now so i stopped, but in the middle of it i remembered a true crime where i can't even think or look at icepicks anymore cause of it. it made me really anxious, and i actually used to get that thought aswell before when i pleasured myself its been awhile since i did get that thought, but i used to be able to push it away.  so anyway after i finished, i got somewhat anxious about it, but i know i wasn't originally doing it to any thoughts, and that i don't want to hurt anyone. so while i feel abit anxious, i did push the thought away for alittle bit.  i mean i shouldn't have been pleasuring myself, cause i find it a compulsive thing, but still its worse when intrusive thoughts happen during."

My self image is shattered when I look in the mirror I no longer see myself not one of the voices in my head is me.

And honestly I'm tired I just want to go to sleep so I don't have to feel this pain. I can't do anything I line anymore everytime I do it feels soulless everytime I look at the past It doesn't feel like my past anymore I want this to end but honestly I don't even know what that means anymore my OCD has convinced me this is normal. Life is just stress confusion and suffering. It feels like nothing will help at this point this is the farthest I've been dragged down it's like my brain is trying to rewrite me and I'm too tired to fight back.

BBlank223,1,"so earlier in the night, i read an article about this door dash driver who left a note for someone not tipping, i scrolled down more and there was another article about a ""women filing for divorce after this picture"". the thumbnail thingy had this family photo thingy but the dad's hands were abit weirdly placed in my opinion, but they circled the hand with a red circle pointing it out, so anyway i read it, it was actually her finding a pic of her husband's second family who she then found out was her husbands twin's family, and then i turned out to be a fake story. but the inital thing started to give me pocd thoughts, i only clicked it cause i was like, usually these stories turn around and are something else it was a clickbait thing.  anyway my ocd theme then changed from what it was earlier, which was me freaking out and thinking i was into my family members, im not. anyway i kinda distracted myself, but then i thought of this smut i read, all the characters are above age in it, i didn't re read that one, but while the pocd thoughts were ruminating still. i then started reading smuts of kpop idols exo, im a weirdo i know. anyway after i finished, and somewhat during.  my thoughts were like ""your jerking off to the thought of children"" which i wasn't. i don't ever want to.  i used to read shota smut, but it was mostly just people aging characters down, but these thoughts like to pick into your brain and hurt you. i have a problem with jerking off in general and im trying to stop cause it's not helping my mental health at all.  i apparently trained myself to jerk off when bored and to groinal responses, cause i don't think i felt any arousal.   what do i do? how do i bring this up when i start therapy? i need advice."
BBlank223,1,"i get these thoughts about anything, one that i got today was from seeing a thumbnail on youtube. like it fucking sucks, and im over it cause i want a normal relationship with my family, but because of both ocd and ptsd the intrusive thoughts are like ""you're attracted to them"" which im not and i know im not.  it might be because i have a strained relationship with my brother, but i get weird and anxious around him, and my thought are like ""you act weird, this confirms it"", but thats just cause of trauma i have from him growing up, and i know that and its hard to stop the rumination.  he recently got a girlfriend, who i haven't met yet, but i want to meet her, my social anxiety and mental state makes it impossible for me to thought, cause there's a part of me that feel jealous, in a weird way, that my brother was falling apart while ago and i was fine but now that im falling apart he's fine, i don't understand it and i feel so numb. but then there is alos the intrusive thought that ""you're jealous cause of the dating part"".  i hate this, i want normal thoughts. i want to be normal.  i was going to start dating years ago and i still have a want to, i haven't dated before but i don't want to now cause i feel like it would be a ""see im not into my family"" kinda situation and i dont want to use anybody for that.  anyone know what to do?"
shadowXXe,44,"I don't have gender dysphoria. But my brain is constantly trying to convince I'm in fact a woman even though I don't feel like one I don't have the desire to be one it feels like I'm at war with myself and everytime I manage to pull out of it my brain goes ""well you're having these thoughts for a reason"" and I get pulled right back in. I was perfectly happy and fine with my gender identity before but now I have to constantly look i the mirror and reassure myself I'm a man it's happening so often it's become a tic. It's actually gotten to the point where I have almost vomitted out of pure stress it's also caused my disassociate too I don't feel like I'm me anymore it feels like someone else's trying to hijack my body and mind. I'm sorry if this was offensive to any transgender folk I'm honestly not trying to discredit your experiences or anything I'm just sharing what's happening to me"
Ogenz,31,"Does anyone else feel numb, like they don't want anythink, an think like ""whatever""? I feel like I don't care about things, I think like ""I don't care what I'm gonna wear today"" and I also don't get as excited for things as I used to before. I have been taking meds, so maybe it's meds that make me feel like that. Can meds change personality? Ppease help."
Lizziemaughan17x,12,iv just lost my empathy and emotions I have to over think and question every emotion because it feels like I’m faking it a year ago it’s like I was in love with this guy my feeling we’re real strong and pure now it feels like denial like I’m faking it all sometimes I don’t even feel any emotions to anything so therefore I’m afraid I won’t get into a relationship because I won’t have the boy crazy crush feeling and feel the way I did with boys before this happened iv been like this 8 months it’s been hard but got better but I just think it’s ripped apart of me away that I’ll never get back I’ll never be normal emotion me it’s like it’s ruined my life that might be abit dramatic idk
BBlank223,1,"so i watched a reaction video of someone watching the new suicide squad move, there was some really unnecessary gory parts in the movie. i originally wanted to watch the movie but in all i think i shouldn't cause it did somewhat trigger my intrusive thoughts.  before i started using reddit as my rant/therapy space, i was looking stuff up on reddit about intrusive thoughts to see if people were having simaular thoughts, and that i wasn't the only one. i was looking at something else completely for intrusive thoughts. and then i saw a post that had gory sexual trigger warnings, i didn't click into the post, but it made me anxious, and i kinda just ruminate about that aswell, expecially after watching the movie thingy.  there is something very wrong with my brain, cause its like, ""you know and want stuff like that"", but i dont want to hurt or kill anyone, and i'm scared i'm a crazy person. i want to be normal. i should stay away from action movies in general now. cause i'm now scared of running into triggers.  there are more non gory triggers, like i can glance at something romantic in terms of youtube videos, and then my mind fills in a blank of a person, which is usually the only two people i hang out with which is family members and that is disgusting.  i don't know what to do cause i feeel emotionally unwell, and numb. and im afraid of myself sometimes, even thought i know i never want any of my thoughts.  any advice?"
BBlank223,1,"i don't know if this is depression or not, but i get intrusive thoughts and i don't really react to them. i hate them and i have rumination, and i think i get slightly anxious. but i feel emotionally numb to them, and i don't know why.  also does adhd effect intrusive thoughts? cause i bounce from one intrusive thought to the next and i happens a lot, it can sometimes happen every couple of hours, i need someone to talk too. how do people make friends again?"
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,I have contamination OCD from cdiff and I've been at a really low point lately and the effing toilet almost overflowed this morning. I can't I CANT I CANT I CANT SO THIS ANYMORE I WANT TO BE PUT OUT OF MY MISERY MY LIFE IS PURE TORTURE AND SUFFERING!!!! UGHHHHHHH
massivesmoke,49,"i know this might get a lot of negative feedback knowing that the causes of ocd are currently unclear and there is no known way to actually cure it, you just learn to manage it. I have heard about some people ""ending"" ocd through meditation, things like ""qi gong"" (idk if i got the name right), and eastern methods for developing mental health and awareness. But is there any documented case really for someone magically ending ocd once and for all? or even undocumented, i would love to hear storie, because why not? there is nothing to lose really."
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,Does anyone else suffer from contamination OCD caused by cdiff fear?
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,Contamination OCD is ruining everything. I love animals but I can't have closeness with them bc my OCD. I love my boyfriend but I can't have a functional relationship with him bc ocd. I love food but I can't enjoy it bc ocd. I can't do anything. I'm lifeless.
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,"Im not saying this isnt an aspect of ocd(it is and my heart goes out fr those suffering) but does anyone else find it really annnoying how ocd is being represented in the media and it seems like we're making progress with it , but their just showing either lots of cleaning or checking things, no ones ive seen ever goes into other types of ocd like real event pocd etc"
BBlank223,1,"so i was having tocd thoughts, i usually try to distract myself from intrusive thoughts, i decided to play video games, i got bored after awhile and then decided to read some fanfiction, i usually filter ones that could trigger me. i decided to skim through this one batman fanfiction that had 19 chapters, it was supposed to be a hurt comfort one, and it was. but there was this one part between two of the characters who are technically brothers. sometimes people when they ship these two they usually don't have them call eachother family like that. i usually never even go on that ship, i accidentally read one earlier for them. cause i forgot to filter, and i read the 4 chapters of it. but i wasn't having intrusive thoughts about that one till i read th second one later.  anyway the fic was tagged to have no relationships in it so i thought it was normal. but one of the two apparently got drugged and then this weird flirt happened they called it forbidden and then they kissed, i skipped the rest of that chapter, in all honesty i didn't even like that fic cause there was an innuendo about one of them and their other adopted brother, but it was a platonic hurt/comfort situation that it was happening in and i didn't realize that they were showering until the jokes started happening. like i said i was skimming to try and get rid of my tocd. it just started an onslaught of intrusive thoughts even though none of them are technically related.  and since i apparently trained my brain to react to groinal responses, i then masturbated to a kpop smut, which i didn't even want to do. i didn't feel aroused, and i felt gross after  should i just stop reading fanfiction in general, cause its one of 4 things i actually do now.  i have no social life, i usually play games, watch twich stream or youtube. and then i read. i was thinking about stopping until i can get my intrusive thoughts under control. but i don't know what i should do.  i rant and vent alot on reddit. cause i have no therapist, im supposed to go and get oriantation for the second time, cause i kinda stopped going to therapy before the pandemic, and my therapist dropped me. i was only going for anxeity anyway so it's kinda a good thing she did, cause oriantation means i can start fresh with a new therapist, instead of just being like, ""i have ocd now"" even thought i had it then. i just didn't talk about it then and i didn't even talk about my intrusive thoughts then either. i feel like i would be called a liar.  what should i do?  EDIT:added parts i wanted to talk about but forgot to"
carter_pride,46,"I worked so hard and accomplished so much today.  I was really jazzed at the end of work.  Then I made the mistake of talking to my mother and then my girlfriend, and it was awful because they are both toxic and unavoidable.  It triggered me and my mind got flooded with racing, intrusive thoughts: I can usually “hear” voices just demeaning me, cutting me down, and insulting me.  It’s like it knows what to say to kill every little bit of hope I steal and scavenge from working hard all day.  So I took a break and locked myself away from everyone in my house.  Then I went to a mental health forum and I started reading about this guy talking about how OCD interfered with his reading skills his whole life.  It was such a familiar story, and it suddenly dawned upon me that I hadn’t even made that connection my entire life, and so I just started crying alone in my room because it made a lot of sense and was cathartic.  Anyway.  Life goes on. It’s a lonely road.  Keep fighting, my friends.    And if you’re tired - rest a little, but keep going."
RockyK96,36,dk if this is seperate or OCD related
BBlank223,1,"so i was having dark intrusive thoughts, cause i saw a post on reddit i didn't click into, that had very dark gorey sexual trigger warnings in the title. i saw it like two weeks ago, i pushed it into the back of my mind. but when i remembered it this morning while having harm ocd towards myself. i got a weird groinal response, this was after a full night of no sleep. i was anxious so then i went to bed.  when i woke up i kinda forgot for a minute or two then it came rushing back in, so then i thought if i masturbate to something else it will cancel out the thoughts, cause it sometimes works like that for me. i probably should stop cause it does backfire.  but it's more of a "" see i don't like these thoughts, kind of thing. i feel somewhat better but the dark thoughts are still ruminating, what should i do?"
tgott1686,28,Anybody take celexa and it stopped working for them and still had success with lexapro afterwards?
Lizziemaughan17x,12,"I’m just drained with this situation with the guy iv liked for so long and I still care but not how I used to but idk if it’s the ocd or cuz I’m sick of his bullshit either way I’m thinking I’m a lesbian and I’m scared I won’t feel the way I did with boys , I never had to over think or question my emotions or feelings a year ago and now I do it’s hard to explain it’s like I’m scared I won’t feel love or heartbreak I don’t wanna feel it but I’m just scared I don’t have any emotions and they will never be as strong and real as they was a year ago everything feels like I’m faking it"
Elusive-Yoda,25,How has your day been?
BBlank223,1,"so i have being having harm thoughts all nights, there was one where i thought of something. so before i started posting, i used to search on reddit for reassurance in a way for a different problem in my thoughts. before i learned it was bad to get reassurance. anyway i saw this one post, i didn't click into it, but when i was searching for something that one popped up and it left all the gory trigger warnings in the title, it was descriptive trigger warnings. it's kinda sad that i can't just forget glancing at it after i pushed it into the back of my mind.  its probably going to stick with me all day. this sucks."
sharksandpickles,45,Lately I've been getting these false memories. I was convinced I had commented something sexual about an underaged anime character in an edit... so I worried for hours and checked almost every single edit I could find of the character just to find out I never commented that. I hate how now I can't even trust my memory when I'm trying to reassure myself that I'm not a bad person.
Master-Champion-1528,42,"It feels so real it’s scary. I don’t want [forbidden word] even though that’s clearly what I want because I want an answer to this whole mess, but everytime I get an answer that says “you’re not one because of this or that” it convinces me for 5 minutes or for a little while. Then I start to question everything and doubt everything. And each day the thoughts give me more anxiety and when they don’t I get anxious because I still get groinal responses. And I start to doubt even ig I’m faking it. And it’s so hard I feel drained and irritated, I can’t anymore. It’s so horrifying because people tell me accept the uncertainty, but the uncertainty is so terrifying. I got one of the worst intrusive thoughts this week, which was “what if I get an erection of a kid touching me” because I read that an actual paedophile did that. I was certain that would never happen then I started to doubt it and I got one of the strongest groinal responses, bordered on an anxiety attack. I can’t stop checking to see if I’m getting aroused or I can’t stop testing myself by looking at pictures of kids, but each day it feels like the possibility might become real. So I test myself with the biggest anxiety I ever get because I think the answer will change. I sometimes sound like I’m trying to convince muself that I’m not, and start to wonder if I’m in denial. It’s honestly terrifying, I get scared can a person with OCD even be self aware. My thoughts get worse every moment that passes, and I genuinely can’t  hear words that try to convinve me otherwise, because my brain uses them against me. I honestly can’t do this anymore."
BBlank223,1,"so i like a dumbass, while have intrusive thoughts decided to jerk off to a porn video, to try to get my thoughts to latch somewhere else, it actually help last time i was having intrusive thoughts, but i feel somewhat worse now, i mean the intrusive thoughts are going away.  but i have a weird feeling of anxiety now cause of it.   what should i do?"
NameIntrepid,9,"After days of not giving into the thoughts and rumination I finally got a feeling of noticing the thoughts aren’t me and they don’t control me. It’s a wonderful feeling not being trapped into thinking that all of these things just floating around in my mind don’t define me. I still have a long way to go but I’m happy I’ve hit this landmark. Never give up on yourself, you deserve to have a clear head free of these awful thoughts and stress. I wish you all the best throughout your journey. I’m deleting this app again for good :)."
BBlank223,1,"so i have a theory, mostly cause i have to social life. most of my intrusive thoughts about other people are usually about the people i spend time with. which is my mom and brother. does intrusive thoughts work like that?   do you think my mental state would be better if i got out more/ made more friends?"
turquoiseturtle01,5,I got a new phone case recently from Claire’s. I have been taking really good care of it but noticed a small scratch that’s noticeable in the light. The scratch frustrated me for a second but then I calmed down and left it as it is. I think I might’ve made that scratch on the phone case with my nail on accident but it’s very minor. I also have other phone cases to use saved just in case but still using the new phone case for now. I’m still practicing accepting big/small things flawed that I own in the condition they are in. So far these past few weeks I haven’t had any obsessive thoughts and trying to still limit things that cause obsessive images and thoughts.

Lizziemaughan17x,12,There’s been a guy iv liked for 2 years he doesn’t meet me put any effort in he last met me 8 months ago he’s constantly going back to his ex filling my head with shit bla bla and all iv done was beg for the bare minimum off him and he still never gave me that so basically a year ago I’d get upset over the little things and feel so much hurt and maybe 3 weeks ago I’d get upset if he did something but now I just feel like I don’t care he told me last night he’s not ready to move on and I felt hurt but I didn’t cry it’s like my empathy is gone aswell like a brick wall in my mind so I’m scared I won’t feel in love and the crush boy crazy feeling I had before all this because now I over think and question everything if I get upset about him if I don’t get upset what if this bla bla when a year ago all my feelings and emotions were strong and real and I never had to think what if I’m faking it I never had all this fucking shit so why don’t I feel anything why can’t I be normal ffs 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️😕
SlipInternational593,47,"Do you find crime documentaries, especially the ""unsolved mysteries"" themes, particularly triggering? Like they will just send you into a full-blown OCD attack. I think for me they are by far at the top of my exposure hierarchy...."
BBlank223,1,"so i made a post eariler talking about how i should read smut tags and, how i got to read really dark shit in smut a couple of times cause of it, where it always ended in a death. never activally looked fore that stuff, and i learn how to filter beetter on ao3, but i started getting intrusive thoughts cause of the post so i deleted it,  but one of my  thoughts made me remember, i usued to like 3d animation porn, on rule 34 they usually put anything, it was from an mmo i used to play, it makes me anxious thinking about it. but there was this one picture that truly scares me that i saw, i saw it like twice, mostly cause i was scrolling. i just ignored it and went back to jerking off to other 3d animations.  i hate these thoughts, i also feel so emotionally numb at the same time. and it somewhat scares me.  ""are you into these things"" or ""you must be cause you read the smut"" which when i read it i skimmed it then left to go read a different one, there was a weird impulse to go read the same one. which i did atleast once more. i think i did it with 4 more different smut fics.   i saw the doctor today for my medications, i got prescribed a new one that will hopefully help my intrusive thoughts, cause that's what we decided to target. i just want to be normal.  when i was remembering these thoughts i was about to eat food, and then i was thinking about ""what if my food is human meat"" i knew it wasn't, i ate this food all the time, so i ate it anyway. i ended up throwing it up later(i have been throwing up alot lately, don't know if its cause of anxiety).  my brain feels all wrong, i hate remembering stuff i saw years ago.   what should i do?"

littledaisy_07,8,"Hello. I’ll make it as short as I can. I have contamination OCD with hand-washing compulsions. Thanks to CBT, I managed to reduce them and to wash my hands 10 times a day. However, I’ve been really struggling with it for a few days and been washing my hands more (on average 15 times a day). The thoughts also feel unbearable and my anxiety is way higher than it was in July. Is that a relapse? If so, what can do until my next therapy appointment, which is in a few days? Does that mean my meds aren’t efficient? Thank you!"

Master-Champion-1528,42,"I hate whatever this is I doubt everything. Like literally everything (Trigger Warning) I was talking to my therapist and how do I know if it’s OCD and she said that if it wasn’t POCD I would find pleasure in these thoughts and not be horrified. And it seemed logical, except maybe after 10 minutes I got the “what if’s” and it was so horrifying because it was “What if you like the thoughts” “What if you masturbate to the thoughts” and I started getting groinal responses and I’m constantly checking to see if I’m getting aroused by the thoughts. I wasn’t but, I was terrified because I couldn’t do my compulsion of checking because I was scared I would get aroused and started masturbating or something. Short story I couldn’t sleep. The worst part is that usually my dogs give me a sort of therapy, I sleep with my chihuahua in my bed and I can’t even do that anymore, because I remembered watching bestiality porn when I was younger and I got scared I might do something to them. So now I feel alone, because I told my parents what’s happening and they said that I’m not doing my part to help myself. That I need to go outside and everything will be fine, but I’m scared at the mere sight and sound of a child to the point, where my therapist has decided that this semester in College has to be online for me, because I’m too emotionally unstable. And they don’t understand that, they think I’m making this up. To the point where both my sister and mother were saying they were suicidal because of me. I honestly can’t, and then the doubt of “what if I’m faking this” arises and I get so scared because I still stand by it. I’d rather be dead than be a paedophile. And I can’t come to terms with the uncertainty because it’s my biggest fear. I doubt everything, the thoughts and images feel so real that they horrify me. I’m constantly googling symptoms and I feel certain it’s OCD for a second, but then doubt arises and I read about people who masturbate to their thoughts and I get so terrified. I get scared what if therapy and the pills don’t work. I’m so scared of this, and the fact I’m also hurting people is so draining. I can’t even be calm, because I start to think am I accepting the thoughts, did I like them, and that would explain the groinal response. I wish I could just shut my brain off, or go back to when I didn’t trigger any of these thoughts I genuinely feel hopeless and alone. I can’t anymore, my therapist says it’s classic OCD, but what if it’s not. I genuinely see no light. Sometimes I get groinal responses and I don’t get as anxious, becuae I kind of know what it is, but then I start doubting and get even more anxious. Please I can’t anymore."

BBlank223,1,"So i identifiy as a gay male, so when i played video games(mmos) when i was younger i always pretended to be a girl in them, kinda catfishing i did it in two different games years apart the first one was for easier leveling and flirting somewhat, which was super dangerous cause i was lying about my age(i was like 10), and the other one was just for flirting with guys. i think it was an attention thing, what's interesting is both times i started with male characters then when i made new characters. they were female. i had options to admit that i was male, but at times it felt to late and stuff and i felt anxious about it.  so i still play one of these game i deleteted the whole account and made a new one with new character s, male and female. i'm going to be truthful if i make friends in them but i kinda keep to myself in mmo's now.  other problems i have is i like making up stories in my head, like scanarios for characters, celebrities, kpop idols, where i pretend to be them in my head, for like an hour a day. i think its somewhat an escape mechanism or something. i also did it with like  ""what would i be like as a celebrity"" or stuff like that. whenever i made scenarios for myself i was always male in them.  i also have a guilty pleasure of looking at beauty videos and stuff. like hair styles and cutting videos. for both male and female. and i would look up hairstyles for both aswell.   when i was super young i had a higher voice, and with my behaviour problems i use to scream and yell.  my mom was on the phone and the person said ""how old is your daughter"" and i recently remember situations like that.  i know that i usually like female characters in tv show then males. i actually don't know why.  sometimes when i have to state my gender on stuff i feel uncomfortable cause of my intrusive thoughts, even though i'm 100% sure i'm male.  like beginning/before the pandemic i wasn't having these thoughts or feelings. i felt comfortable seeing stuff about lgbtq+ stuff everywhere. but when i see trans youtubers or stuff where people have to clarifiy themselfs it makes me nervous about misgendering, cause im also nervous about doing it to myself even though i go by He/Him.  i have weird intrusive thoughts that lead to weird phantom feelings. i think im going crazy."
pleaseimconfused,21,"TW Ed’s and POCD  Hello. I am 17f and diagnosed with OCD. I have also struggled with disordered eating behaviors since I was quite young, around middle school age.  I think I recently had a breakthrough that I am not attracted to kids, but I am instead really envious of their bodies. I think of my childhood self and admire how skinny my legs were, I get giddy whenever I find old clothes fitting me, and when I fantasize about age appropriate people I always imagine myself as really skinny and more petite. I wouldn’t ever date a kid and I don’t find anything appealing about them but I am so jealous of their silhouettes. I wish I had the same bodies as those skinny middle school aged girls. Sometimes I confuse false attraction for jealousy.  I remember once I saw a girl who was so so skinny and her body made me envious. Idk how old she was but I realized she looked young and freaked out bc I thought it meant I was attracted to her. No, I literally wish I could have those exact proportions."

sharksandpickles,45,"I posted about this once but I still feel horrible. I was looking for pics of one of my favorite duos from this one anime and I scrolled down. I found a doujinshi. For some stupid reason, I decided to read it. I felt uncomfortable and I tried avoiding looking at the other character. I was only looking at my favorite character, because I also found him attractive. I got groinal responses from one panel of him. He was about to take off the other guy's clothes while kissing him. Again, I didn't look at the other guy because I felt uncomfy, but I'm pretty sure I thought it was attractive of him (by him I meant my favorite character).. This is gonna sound disgusting but I imagined myself in the other guy's place. I even took a screenshot. And I got groinal responses. I don't think they were unwanted ones. I feel so guilty and bad. Why did I do that?? I wanna punch myself. I wanna die. They weren't even naked or anything but I still feel horrible. I did delete the pic almost right after because I started feeling extremely guilty. It's been months and it's still bugging me. I couldn't sleep properly that night. And I constantly felt the need to confess.  The thing is, I like the characters together but I've never thought about the whole thing of ""which one is the top and which one is the bottom"" thing. I couldn't care less about that. It's nasty to ehen think of it. I liked their backstory in the anime. But I never thought about how they had sex. I only liked them as a duo. But now I can't even look at the other guy the same way. I even had photos of him in my wall, but now I wanna put them away. I'm scared I'm fetishizing them. I don't wanna fetishize gay men. I don't even read yaoi for my own pleasure just because it's two guys doing something dirty together. I don't see gay people as sex objects or something like that. I think fujoshis are gross. But how am I any different??? I wish I never did that. Now I get intrusive thoughts about the characters doing dirty things and I sometimes even get groinal responses, which leads me to constantly doing compulsions.  I geniunely feel like a horrible person."

Infinite_Tax_6567,3,It’s mainly about keeping things I want to say to people from myself like my brain will tell me”you’re not a brave person because you didn’t say this to this person “ or itlll question if I was brave enough to say something to someone so I actually say it to the person
RockyK96,36,Who am I outside of it? Realizing “oh that’s a compulsion” to everything I do has been scary and eye opening. I sometimes have to question whether im doing something because I want to or if it’s compulsory. It dictates my entire life.
BBlank223,1,"so i was listening to music for like an hour, which during i was having tocd intrusive thoughts, i took a sip of water dropped the cap on the floor and since i think the cap was dirty i couldn't touch it anymore so i went to throw away the water, earlier in the day i saw a knife in the silverware drawer, or i think it might of been the day before, i usually never go in that draw(cause i have sensory issues with metal in my mouth) so when i was wasing my hands after picking the bottle cap up. the thoughts kinda came rushing in. it was about stabbing my mom.  so i went to her room and woke her up and she hid the knife(she knows about some of my intrusive thoughts) after that i washed my hands a couple more times. then grabbed a water and went back to my room.  i then went to my computer to start watching youtube to try and distract myself from the thoughts and and the anxiety. i have constipation atm from medication i was taking, i stopped taking it but it give weird tingling feelings in my butt and groin area sometimes, which i thought was a groinal response to the thoughts then i started to get anxious again.  then i threw up(i kinda have been recently) i don't know if out of anxiety or not.  i think im obessessing about obssessing stuff and its making me crazy."
BBlank223,1,"so like a dumbass i responded to a groinal response, basically what happened was i was having them on and off for a couple of days. i was also obsessing over what i want to talk to my therapist about, which if you read my last post you'd read some of my ongoing problems. it was somewhat making me have pocd and stuff.  so i decided to watch a porn video of the sims, and since i knew it was a bad idea i was already thinking of what to say on reddit so i spent the whole minute before ejaculating watching two pixalated men, and thinking of what to post cause i had some anxiety before.  but then i realized i wasn't aroused by anything from my thoughts and video(there were some flashes of intrusive thoughts during for like a split second but i pushed it away).  my intrusive thoughts stopped(i think i had a moment of clarity )  i started looking back at some stuff in my head, and realized most of the time i jerked off(i think atleast 70%) it was me reacting to a groinal response or bored. and even during masturbation as well.  i don't know if this is a thing that can happen or not.  Edit:Grammer"
tgott1686,28,Is it normal to get increased anxiety when going up in dose of abilify?
BBlank223,1,"I'm writing this in a okay-ish headspace right now, but i need to let stuff off my chest and to talk to someone and opinions. I read Fanfictions, mostly angst, angst with happy ending etc. i started reading when i was like 9-10. i also started reading smut. i think i need to talk about kinks i actually like reading about.  Exhibitionism, Public Sex, Doctor-Patient, Teacher-Student, Slight age Difference and some others like Degradation and BDSM.  stuff that sprinkled in with it was disgusting, i usually skimmed those fics. (Cause there was some impulse for me to click on it) those topics had  Shota, Beastality, knife play and other dark things,  usually in the shota kinda things it was characters or people being aged down. the last few things scare me. and make me think i'm a monster. but it was a thing i stumbled into and then it was an impulse to read atleast twice more. for some of the fics then i forgot about them until the intrusive thoughts started up again recently.  i also got into Incest fics but i never was attracted to anyone in my family. my intrusive thoughts are killing me. cause i get images flash into my brain. then a weird feeling in my hands.  i have more problems i want to talk about but i don't know how to bring them up in this post. or how to word it."
NameIntrepid,9,I’m learning to accept the thoughts as just thoughts and continue on with my days. It’s really hard and taking a lot of time but I’m getting there. I constantly have this feeling of doubt when I get a tiny bit of control over my mind. And it’s weird because it’s only when I’ve gotten used to the thoughts and began to control them. Any advice on getting past that?
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,"Those of you while struggle with OCD around health and hypochondria, how do you cope? What things have helped you. Any advice? Thank you"
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,"DAE notice throughout the span of their life that certain things that trigger or are revolved around OCD have been around different things at different time in your life? That certain things have came and gone, some stay but once one thing you have goes on a few months, years and so on it fades away or you find a way to cope with it only for something new to emerge and cause you to struggle?"
purple07631,15,"A friend recently came to clean my room. My friend, who understands my illness, let me look in his bag on the way home to see if he stole anything, but I suspect that there is a book missing. I have a constant fear of harm. Please help me, what can I do?  I can't forgive myself for doubting my friend. Please forgive me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Master-Champion-1528,42,"These thoughts feel too real. I get groinal responses like crazy. I’m always checking to see if I’m getting an erection because all day I’m paying attention to my groinal area cause I feel something. Most of the time I worry if I liked it. I thought I liked the thought for a second not too long ago, even though I didn’t because I got immediate anxiety and disgust. I can’t sleep well, I can’t masturbate, I ca watch tv because a kid might appear, I can’t go outside for the same reason. I’m terrified. I ask people for reassurance contantly I’m googling my symptoms basically every minute. I doubt everything. To the point I doubt I’m even being honest writing this. I get scared because sometimes I remind myself it’s OCD, but then I start thinking can a person be self aware about OCD and I get scared that I might be lying to my therapist and to myself. I doubt everything I don’t know myself. I have a literal mental breakdown every day. I can’t anymore, I tell myself I don’t like these thoughts, but immediately I start to question “what if I’m in denial” or trying to convince myself and immediately blank out in fear. I’d rather be dead than be a paedophile even if it’s a non offending one because I find it disgusting and it goes against my morals. But I slmetimes even doubt that sentence becaue I start to get thoughts like “what if that’s what you want to believe”. I honestly can’t anymore. Other than having POCD for months now I started to devlop zooliphic thoughts, and I get scared of petting my dogs. I get scared that I might get aroused doing so, and it pains me because during these months of pain and doubt she kept me company and now I feel alone becauee I’m scared of hurting her. Please I can’t go on is this even OCD anymore?"
turquoiseturtle01,5,Today my mom helped me put some books in the plastic book covers. A few time some of the edges got bent and I got frustrated at first then calmed down and let them be as they are in the book covers. It was hard at first but I am now slowly trying to learn to accept my books in the condition they are in. I at least know too that they are safe in the covers but will be practicing trying to not overthink how they look bent/old while I read them.
RockyK96,36,"This is how sinister OCD is, you learn to cope with thoughts as just being thoughts and not who you are so real event comes in and warps your memories and goes “but it is who you are! see? here’s the examples” and it feels harder to ignore than the original intrusive thoughts and you constantly relive events and try to remember every detail to know if you are bad or not for sure when you never will. You’ll ask people for reassurance about things but will never be satisfied."
purple07631,15,"I don't talk about sleep anymore unless I have to because no one really understands me when it comes to sleep. I guess that's because I'm crazy. I feel very lonely now, even though I have friends. Recently, I've been feeling awkward with a friend I was particularly close with. I feel lonely about that too. I feel like I don't want to be around people anymore. I don't know if it's because of my illness or something else (I have other disabilities as well). I often clash with people. I don't like it and I hate it. If I have a conflict with someone, is it wrong to use my illness as an excuse?"
NameIntrepid,9,I also have DPDR so it could explain how I’m feeling. It feels like my reality is being replaced with this indescribable vibe like feeling and I hate it so much.
pleaseimconfused,21,"hello. i’m 17f diagnosed with ocd  edit: by worse on purpose i don’t mean i’m trying to make myself more sick but i end up thinking bad stuff on purpose. i think that may also me a compulsion because it happens usually when i’m stuck in a severe thought loop and suddenly i decide to try taking control of it myself  sometimes i will get stuck in an intrusive thought spiral to the point i get tics or can’t focus on anything. sometimes what i do then is start treating it like a joke and leaning into the thoughts but then i think i end up doing compulsions without realizing.  like i have pocd and my brain kept making everything about sexual thoughts to the point i couldn’t even look at makeup items or watch asmr videos without feeling anxiety and getting intrusive thoughts. so at one point i just started laughing at myself and making up a scenario on purpose. then i got this compulsion to try to kiss the other person in my thoughts. i’m not even attracted to this person, they’re like 12 but i guess i felt like i needed to know how i’d react and also to see if i can “handle” it?"
purple07631,15,I'm afraid to go to sleep today. But morning will soon be here. I can't take the sleeping pills prescribed by the hospital because I'm afraid that I might have a scary dream when I need to sleep. It's hard. Does anyone know how to deal with it?
Master-Champion-1528,42,I tried doing what somebody said when I started to post on this subreddit and imagine triggering scenarios and trying to avoid compulsions. I don’t know if this is how it works so if somebody can help me that’d be great?
turquoiseturtle01,5,Yesterday I put lemons in my room to try to get rid of the ants. I heard that citrus in lemon scares away ants because they don’t like the smell. I wrapped and rubber banded the lemons and put them on the floor in different parts of my room. Tonight I started to see ants on my bed. I am started to get really grossed out and worried that they’ll climb on me and try to bite. I still have to keep spraying my room with Lysol and another carpet spray but the ants still keep coming back. I hope I can still sleep at night. I’ve had bad experiences with ant problems at home before and thought they were gone for good but I guess not.
turquoiseturtle01,5,Im so stressed and anxious about the book bends from today. My head is still tingling and aching. I can’t stop obsessing over the mistake I made of trying to put the book in the plastic cover by accidentally creating bends on the corners of the book. Now I have annoying images in my head of the bending and can’t get it out. I wish it could be fixed without it being ruined. I wish I didn’t have to worry about small things like that but some traumatic things recently have triggered me into obsessing over the condition of things I own and my past childhood.
turquoiseturtle01,5,"I have an update on therapy/counseling. After a long discussion with my mom, she finally agreed to let me see my college counselor. As soon as the fall semester starts, I will be scheduling an appointment through Zoom for counseling."
Alternative-Jaguar55,48,"So this may be a long irritating post but I just don't know where else to put it.  I have been diagnosed with OCD since a very young age, my mother has it as well. Through the years I've obsessed over many things and even to the point where I had harmful physical tics. I have pushed through it all with the help of loved ones and God. However a few months back I got a cdiff infection and thankfully recovered but since then my OCD has spiralled out of control. It has caused so much damage to my life and relationships and quality of life. Every moment of every day is beyond stressful. For those of you that don't know about cdiff I have done a lot of guilty research on it and have come to learn it's a ridiculous resistant bacteria that basically lives on everything and only bleach can kill it and even after infection is over you have spores meaning I can't take antibiotics or my gut bacteria will be thrown off and spore can become active again. There's really so much to explain about cdiff it's insane. So every waking moment is trying to avoid it etc. Some of the things I deal with are   1. Washing my hands relentlessly and I mean basically after I touch anything I'm ashamed to say the two people I live with I also ask them to wash their hands after touching things. My hands have open cracks and contact dermatitis from it  2. I have to constantly bleach EVERYTHING. ALL THE TIME ALL DAY ETC I have ruined so many clothes, bedding, light switches etc  3 I cannot eat or drink like a normal person, I have to prepare my food without touching it or wash my hands between different parts of making it I even fear after washing if my hands aren't dry enough bc antibacterial soap potentially getting on my food and it causing cdiff spores to germinate I also have to eat with plastic wear or literally not touch my food and just eat like a dog it's shameful If I touch the mouthpiece of my water bottle I immediately fear drinking out of it again  4. Brushing my teeth is also a stressful tedious task  5. I'm constantly fearing airborne cdiff in the air or from even the air of a door shutting that it somehow got on my mouth so I use the inside of my shirt to wipe my mouth and my lips are raw bc of it. Then I fear if I had something on my shirt and got in on my mouth etc. It's ridiculous  6. I love animals and I discovered animals can be carriers of cdiff do now I can't bond with my cats  7. I cannot explain how much my relationships are suffering bc if the constant stress and unfair expectations I bring  8. I fear any infection bc I can't take antibiotics so I literally obsess over things that aren't even cdiff  9. I can't go out to eat and feel comfortable I can't touch anything and feel comfortable I can't do anything and feel comfortable I can't do normal daily tasks like laundry enjoy being outside etc etc etc   10. I'm trying to better understand or make myself feel better and I obsessively google so much and it gets me nowhere but downhill   These are just a FEW of the things that make is so draining for me every single day.  Idk what to do at this point I'm sorry for the lengthy ridiculous post but I just needed to vent. Thank you."
turquoiseturtle01,5,I tried putting on a clear plastic sleeve book protector on a book while my mom went for an errand. The book was the right size and I put the front and back covers through the sleeves carefully but it caused small bends. I was having so much panic that I started to scream and cry. I tried the best I could to put the book in the plastic cover but it still got bent. I also prayed because of how much panic I was in. I also impulsively out of frustration and stress reordered the book hoping it comes in better condition to place it in a cover correctly. I am also nervous too because I don’t know if I’ll be in trouble with my mom for ordering the book. I have still been trying to control my thoughts and not give into compulsions but sometimes I lose because of stress.
turquoiseturtle01,5,"I received some plastic book sleeve covers in the mail for my books. My mom was helping me put them on because I didn’t want to ruin them myself even though I’m careful. My mom tried putting one of the books into the book cover sleeve and I told her to be extra careful not to bend the front and back covers but still one of the edges got bent. Now I’m worried how the other books in the plastic covers will turn out, especially since they are new. I have a tingly feeling on the left side of my head because of the stress. The bend was really small on the inside of the corner edge but it’s still annoying because it’s noticeable to me."
turquoiseturtle01,5,"These past few days, I have not been obsessing over things. I’ve been trying to distract myself with watching TV and spending time with my family. I still notice though that my head still gets aches and tingles so I try not to obsess over new things. I am trying to be cautious not to give into new and old obsessive thoughts. I also am trying not to dwell on the past."
littledaisy_07,8,"I want to be a full human being and not just these thoughts, these compulsions and a stupid disorder. It’s weird because I feel like if my brain gives me such thoughts and if my body and mind make me do compulsions, it means that I’m nothing else but OCD. Somehow, I know I’m not only a disorder but it makes me sick. OCD has been stealing so much from me since it became the way it is today and I want it to just stop. I miss my old life, when I could go to bed early, didn’t need meds, didn’t feel so stuck in my own head. It’s disgusting. I hate it more and more every day"
Master-Champion-1528,42,"I’m scared. What if it’s not OCD? What if I’m lying to myself? Yesterday I had a a groinal response and my brain is trying to convince me that I like these thoughts. I can’t deal with this. I don’t want to go outside. I want to chemically castrate myself. I don’t want these thoughts. I’m scared that I might be enjoying them. I’m scared. I’m almost convinced that I am. I want to end it. Sometimes I don’t even feel ancious and I get groinal responses, today I haven’t even reacted until now. Which I’m crying. How do I know it’s just OCD? The worst part is that everything people say to me I start doubting, and it feels very real and it distresses me. I’m scared, I’d rather be dead than be a pedophile. I’m liter suicidal today has been the worst day so far, it feels so real. My appointment with my therapist feels so far away, what if she thinks I’m a paedophile. I hate these thoughts, what if I’m trying to convince myself? I want to end it. I feel like I’m enjoying the thoughts I felt like yesterday I enjoyed a thought and it made me so anxious. I’d rather be dead than be a paedophile even if it’s a non offending one. I’m so scared of the uncertainty, sometimes it feels so convincing. I don’t know myself. I avoid children. I don’t even want to be hospitalized because they put you to see children’s movies and I’m scared. I can’t watch tv because I’m scared. I’m crying. I really want to die. And I think somebody in my previous post thinks I’m a paedophile. I want to kill myself."
Master-Champion-1528,42,"I think I’m liking the thoughts. I readthat paedophilia is egosystonic and that it aligns with their beliefs and self images, and I was calm because I found it repulsive. But these past few days I’ve been scared that I’m switching my morals and that I might like it. Everything I read that calms me turns into a nightmare because I start doubting it. And I’m taking anxiolytics for this but I’m scared because I still get groinal responses and I don’t feel as anxious and I’m scared that I might be liking them or that the sensation feels good. I’m scared. I don’t want these thoughts I’m so horrified by them. Is this even OCD? it feels too real. I swear that if I’m convinced I’m a paedophile I’m killing myself no hesitation whatsoever. I hate this I don’t wsnt to be one. But I don’t know myself anymore. It’s driving me into madness. I avoid children and people tell me that’s a sign of OCD, but now I start doubting that I’m even getting anxious around kids. I’m scared I can’t do this anymore each day that passes feels worse. My therapist says it’s OCD but it feels so real now. I’m scared I doubt everything."
poke000,29,"I am looking for a reason and science-based argument for why this sort of hand washing or germ avoidance is not necessary.  **Example:**  *Let's say you are at a restaurant with your napkin on your leg. As you bring the napkin up to dab your face and hands, the napkin lightly brushes the bottom of the table. Then you wipe your hands with the napkin. Have you now spread any gems from the bottom of the table to your hands? Would this be a good reason to wash your hands?*   Disclaimer: this is a hypothetical example that did not happen to me, but I've experienced similar situations and felt like I needed to wash my hands. Feel free to use a different example to explain your views, since this post is about a general concept, not a specific situation."

I get extremely anxious about washing and drying them because I worry about the dye blending onto to my regular clothes and mixing into gross clothes. A few times some of my really good clothes has been stained from tie dye shirts while washing because my mom puts all my clothes in the washing machine. I have reminded her numerous times but she kept forgetting and not understanding how I felt about the tie dye clothes on ruining my regular clothes. This summer I have been separating my tie dye clothes that I have made or ones I’ve bought premade to wash and dry them individually so that they don’t ruin regular clothes. I just get really annoyed and get obsessive thoughts because it’s hard for me to see things getting stained, especially clothes."

Master-Champion-1528,42,"I’ve been having apart from the intrusive thoughts about paedophilia I got an intrusive thought about zoophilia, and although I felt scared and I feel kind of uncomfortable around my dogs. I don’t feel as anxious as I am when I developed POCD, I still feel uncomfortable because I get these unwanted images, but I don’t doubt myself as much as I did with the POCD. Does this mean something am I faking one or the other, because I’m still terrified of the POCD. Or more so the probability that I might be one, I’m scared I might get aroused around kids or do something. I avoid them completely. I’m getting groinal responses and sometimes I don’t react to them and then I get scared what if I stop checking I might get aroused. I’m so scared of these thoughts. And I read about paedophiles who don’t want their thoughts or feel distressed and I get so scared. Like to the point where I read that paedophiles know without a doubt that they like kids. And I was calm for like a second because I was like “I don’t like kids”, but then I start doubting myself and I don’t know myself anymore. What if it’s all a lie? What if it’s not OCD? What if I want to believe it’s OCD and am in denial? Please I can’t do this anymore? I’m scared of both of these thoughts but one feels so real it’s so scary.

I used to purchase clothes and jewelry on those apps but decided to delete because they were giving me too many obsessive thoughts and images about ordering more. I deleted all my card and other personal information as I was deactivating those accounts. Another reason why those were deleted because of experiences where I was scammed by sellers. After deleting those apps, I have been feeling a lot better."
turquoiseturtle01,5,"For awhile I have had compulsions and obsessions about ordering things online and in store. Usually if I see clothes online or in store I try to get them in every color in a specific size. If certain clothes is sold out, I have to check constantly when it gets back in stock to purchase. There’s been times where clothes are unavailable or in store that I end up getting frustrated that I didn’t have a chance to purchase. It’s especially frustrating and disappointing when there’s been times I haven’t been allowed to buy clothes and then my mind start to get stuck on images of the clothes trying to picture what I would’ve liked with them on. It’s also especially difficult trying to be frugal with my money but then when I start to have obsessive thoughts then I make impulsive decisions that I wish I wouldn’t have made because I either end up not wearing the clothes or run out of space to stores them."

I don’t know if it’s the pills or not, but I can’t anymore. I can’t go outside because I feel groinal responses and I get scared. I can’t do this anymore. I was feeling better the day I started the pills, but I can’t anymore. I’m literally done. These thoughts scare me too much, and I fear that I might like them, or that I’m lying to myself.

Just kill me! Yes euthanize me so I can end the suffering.   I can't work, make no money, have no future, no marriage, nothing. Just kill me and stop torturing me. You are fuckin evil pieces of shit!

Master-Champion-1528,42,"I’ve been taking Luvox and Klonopin for the past 4 days and the first 2 days they worked great, but I couldn’t sleep so I took some melatonin, which I read after taking them that it isn’t exactly good to mix with SSRI’s and anxiolytics. After I took them I’ve felt sick to my stomach, nausea, vomiting, tremors. Are these normal side effects of Luvox? or should I contact both my doctor and my local poison control? Because even after I stopped taking the melatonin I’ve felt sick, stomach aches nonstop, I can’t eat at night because I vomit ecverything that I eat etc. Is this some sort of accidental overdose. Should I be worried."

pleaseimconfused,21,"hi. i’ve been struggling with POCD for the past few months. i’m 17f.   idk if this is because of my pocd or a mixture of my life circumstances (was young for my grade, left my hs early)  i noticed i literally cannot gauge ages properly anymore. i’ll see someone who is most likely 17-20 and my brain will tell me theyre like... 12-14 when all the circumstances and context point otherwise. i once thought a lady who was like 50 years old was a 10 year old 😭.   i also have found the idea of sex with literally anyone to be repulsing. i used to feel like this before too but idk if it’s bc i have sexual trauma or if i’m a pedo. actually i don’t even want to have sex with a kid. i find the idea of seeing a naked person disgusting and i don’t want to touch them. i can feel attracted to celebrities & fictional characters though"

Last night I found an ant by my night stand. I went into a panic because of how much I get grossed out by ants. My mom had me peel up some oranges to put in my room because she said that ants don’t like the smell of the citrus. This morning after I woke up, I found a swarm of ants on an orange peel on my dresser. I got so frustrated and grossed out that I had to remove the orange peels. I had to go spray all around my room constantly because I’m tired of the ants coming in my room. I keep getting obsessive thoughts and worries that the ants could bite me or get on my bed.

RockyK96,36,I’ve read its actually beneficial to people with OCD generally and that it’s something that helps you work through your problems and traumas which sounds great. but I’m so scared that even taking a super baby dose will change my mindset enough to confirm my fear that I don’t actually have OCD and am actually just a horrible person.

turquoiseturtle01,5,I have an IPhone and really good about charging it. Most of the time it gets a good charge. Sometime when I charge it on the wall it will charge on and off. It is so annoying and gets me really frustrated. I keep having to charge it different ways with the cord and charging block and the charging noise gets so annoying. I just worry that when it does that it’ll not get a good enough charge or a swelled up battery.
Master-Champion-1528,42,"The thoughts are back even after taking Klonopin, and I’m actually scared. Today I didn’t feel anxious fue to the pills, but now my anxiety is back and I’m scared.

I’m scared my doctor told me to drink one if I felt anxious, but I don’t want to, because of the possibility of developing an addiction. What should I do to calm myself?, other than compulsions."
turquoiseturtle01,5,"I have been struggling with the condition flaws of things I own that are damaged/getting old. Whenever I see scratching on screens and books ripping and bending, I get high anxiety and obsessive thoughts. My mind starts to wonder on how those things can/can’t be fixed and I end up getting those images in my mind as well. It’s hard for me to look at the flaws because I take good care of my things and it makes me feel sad. I try not to give into compulsions but sometimes I end up rearranging/hiding the things with flaws to limit distractions and obsessive thoughts. It’s been very difficult trying to keep them as they are and it’s hard to get those things replaced, especially if they have important memories attached to them. Would this be considered a type of Pure OCD/Contamination OCD?"
turquoiseturtle01,5,"I was having a good day. I all of a sudden got thoughts and ideas to order plastic removable book covers to protect my books from bending, dust, and ripping. I noticed I have a plastic book cover on a dictionary to try on a different book for reference. I was careful to not bend the front and back covers while placing it on the sleeve of the plastic cover. It ended up being too big but found the next size online that would be a better fit. When I went to my room to put it back on the bookshelf, I noticed small bending in the corner of the front and back cover. I was so frustrated and upset because I was really careful testing out that book in a plastic book cover. I now can’t stop think about the bends on that book and I regret testing it out in that book cover. I keep getting the image of bends in my head. It’s extremely annoying and I also have a headache from overthinking about it."

I have been struggling especially with accepting them as they are but it still causes stress and obsessive thoughts. Any tips on how to learn to accept small/big things as they are?"
turquoiseturtle01,5,I ordered a book from Barnes and Noble recently and it delivered today in the mail. It was packed in a plastic envelope instead of a cardboard box. I opened up the plastic envelope to find that the hardcover book was not shrink wrapped in a plastic seal. There was a tear on the spine of the removable sleeve of the spine. The book was delivered by UPS. I was so disappointed that the book arrived damaged. I tried contacting Barnes and Noble but they said the book was out of stock and that a replacement couldn’t be made because of that. I also mentioned to customer service that I didn’t know how to send the book back by mail and that I didn’t have any transportation to take it to the post office. I also do not have a Barnes and Noble in my area. I feel so stressed and keep having images of the tear damage in my head. It’s so annoying and I wish the obsession and compulsion over the conditions of things I own and order would stop.

When I got home, I went on the Walmart app to see if it’s available online. I clicked on the size and color to add the cart. After that, it kept getting an error that it was sold out which was really annoying and frustrating. I had to contact Walmart customer service chat on the app and the representative said it’s still sold out but it’s still possible for it to be stocked back up again. The representative said they will add my email ti get notifications when it eventually stocks up online. I also still hope to see if maybe they also have that tank top in my size at a second Walmart that I’m near."

I’m scared because today after almost 2-3 weeks without masturbating, I finally did, and these thoughts came at the wrong moment. And I’m scared that what if I hit climax because of these thoughts or something, even though I know I didn’t. I’m scared.

turquoiseturtle01,5,"Thank you all for your support on here. I post a lot on here because I feel comfortable sharing my experiences.   I used to go to therapy and counseling from elementary through high school. After that, my mom stopped me from seeing therapists and counselors because she started not to agree with the things they were telling me. Around that time too I was diagnosed with ASD and had an IEP. When I got into college, I used the Accessability Services for accommodations in my classes. My college also offers counseling and I had a conversation with my mom about seeing a counselor there but she still won’t allow me to get counseling from there.   Since the pandemic happened last year, my motivation for college and my hobbies changed. I felt really isolated and very tired. I become more introverted than extroverted like I used to. This summer a lot has really affected my mental health. I had a traumatic experience involving college that triggered a lot of obsessive thoughts. I have not had an OCD diagnosis but I feel like it is starting to develop since OCD can be associated with Autism.   The obsessive thoughts I noticed having involving things I wish I didn’t give away and that has broken from the past and present. My thoughts became to focused on those things that I could barely sleep and enjoy time with friends and family. I felt so much sadness and frustration because it was hard to let go and accept those things broken and old, especially since those were good memories I had saved.   Eventually my thoughts were starting to go away but then kept coming back. I would try to ignore those things but then new obsessions would come when it was something that would annoy me. I had conversations with my mom about my emotions and was understanding but she still wouldn’t let me get therapy."
turquoiseturtle01,5,These past few weeks have been good without obsessive thoughts but now my worries over the conditions of things are starting to slowly come back. I start to notice the smallest details like scratches and smudges on things like books and screens and it’s so annoying. I am really trying hard not to give into those compulsions but then my mind tells me that those things need to be fixed a certain way. Plus I also get images in my mind and then my head starts to feel achy and tingly. I just want to be able not to be so annoyed about the condition of things. I wish I could see a therapist for ERP but my mom does not believe in me going to therapy.
Master-Champion-1528,42,"I’m scared of the possibility that I’m lying to myself, and that I’m faking my OCD.

Please help, I can’t deal with this anymore."
Master-Champion-1528,42,"What if it’s not POCD and I’m lying to myself and my therapist. I got an erection and I’m scared it might be because of that. My brain tells me “what if it you like those thoughts?” I get scared, I don’t know myself anymoreS it’s so terrifying I hate these thoughts, but they feel so real. I get scared because I read about paedophiles who get anxious becasue of their thoughts. I get calm because I read that it’s mostly because they can’t be with what they want to do, and then my brain shifts to “what if that’s the reason you’re anxious?” And I get scared. Is this even OCD anymore, I’m terrified. My therapist told me it’s OCD but what if I’m lying. Is the erection a groinal response or is that not the case. I’m scared please I need help. I find these thoughts repulsive, but I don’t know myself anymore. I don’t trust myself, I don’t want to be near children in any way shape or form."

turquoiseturtle01,5,I have been doing good but noticed again smudges/finger prints on new books I ordered. It was especially noticeable on a book with a black hardback sleeve cover. I was trying not to get bothered by the finger prints/smudges. I honestly lost with my compulsion and had to try to wipe down the cover with a glasses cloth but did not spray it with anything so that the book wouldn’t get damaged. I just used my breathe to blow on it with cloth to remove those parts. I need to really practice harder by not giving into compulsions like that. I really hope to improve by not getting annoyed and frustrated on the things that aren’t in the best condition.
Master-Champion-1528,42,"She basically said that it was OCD, that we meed to find a way to combat the intrusive thoughts so that I can control them and reassure myself. Which to me seemed kind of a weird suggestion becuase looking for [forbidden word of acceptance] and gathering evidence really brought me to a low point, but she’s a licensed therapist so let’s see how that goes. She also said that I have to gradually expose myself, witha set of rules and that if it doesn’t work that I should tell her so we can try other things. But I think so far I like my therapy (I know kind of early to call victory, but still) She’s very nice, and she told me that basically every symptom described points to OCD, because of the uncertainty and the cknstant state of anxiety. So yeah I just wanted to let y’all know"

pleaseimconfused,21,"hello.. im 17f and I am diagnosed with OCD. POCD kicked my ass for the past few months but I am doing a LOT better. however I had some mild ZOCD themes which developed during my POCD episode because I read about it and then soon it turned into a full-blown fear. I have also developed some weird motor tics like a Tourette form of OCD as a compulsion from ZOCD which is horrible, I have people pointing this out to me and its so embarrassing.  However to me ZOCD made me fear I am attracted to animals especially dogs, I actually don't like dogs very much and find them kinda gross... however ZOCD is constantly in my brain to the point that I constantly have thoughts of a dog following me around in my mind, I feel like I am being followed around by them and I get these disgusting sexual imageries. Sometimes I feel this weird sense of dread when I DONT have an intrusive thought so I will make them up and it only makes things worse. I am really afraid and anxious.  I was thinking of a genuine sexual thought and I got so anxious that I ended up ruining my mood by purposefully thinking something bad because for some reason every second I am hyper vigilant of the fact my thoughts can come back and I feel like they're never going to go away even though I wish I could get rid of them. Im not even aroused by dogs and I never had been. The most I could find to even point to confirm my fear as true is some weird fanfic I read out of morbid curiosity when I was 16, and I never went out searching for that kind of stuff. In fact in the past even though I don't hate furries I even found furry p\*rn to be... not my thing. So the idea of being a zoophile is something I never even.. considered?      Honestly I should have stayed away from OCD websites because I am very easily influenced by negativity and anxiety.  Honestly I know for a fact that I am not a zoophile or any sort of danger to animals because as fucked up as this sounds, in a world where lets say it was perfectly legal and not seen as morally bad, I still would NEVER engage in any sort of contact with animals, literally out of the question."

Elusive-Yoda,25,I hope ocd has been kind to you.
carter_pride,46,"Something that I’m trying more often now is this mantra: “Let the thoughts flow through you.”  Instead of pushing the thoughts away or trying to ignore them, I repeat the “let it flow through you” mantra and relax my body and almost imagine the intrusive thoughts to be a storm that flows through my body.  Seems to be working a little better than screaming and yelling at my brain to shut up.  Also helps with my addictive urges a little bit more than cognitive disputation.  The human mind is like a hungry ghost.  As McNamara said: “Rationality will not save us.”  What a mess.  Wish I could just zap my brain and be cured."

I’d rather be dead than be one, it goes against my morals. People reassure me it’s OCD because I’ve had episodes like this. But what if it’s all a lie. I’m scared I can’t do this anymore. I don’t trust myself. I want to start CBT to see if it helps, but I got scared because I read that it has around an 80% success rate.

turquoiseturtle01,5,Today I got some books delivered from Target. All of the books were in good condition but noticed one of the edges on the cover of the book was folded. I got really annoyed since it was brand new but tried really hard not to be bothered by it. I am trying to practice to leave it as it is without overthinking and replacing/getting rid of it. I plan to get clear book covers from Amazon in different sizes to protect the books eventually. I am just going to leave the books on the shelf standing up for awhile without trying to check constantly.   I still have not had a diagnostic testing for OCD but I am on the Autism spectrum. My mom also won’t allow me to see a therapist. The last time I had counseling and therapy was in high school but after that my mom didn’t allow me to get counseling and therapy. I have tried recently talking to her again about counseling/therapy and she still won’t let me. I am very concerned about the obsessive thoughts I have been having and need support/guidance but it is a very difficult situation. My mom won’t even allow me to get counseling from a counselor that is at my college.

Nobody told me the prison inside my head was OCD.  I was diagnosed so late in my life.    So much pain and suffering - and it was all for nothing.  Not one doctor, not one therapist ever diagnosed me correctly.  How is this possible in the 21st century?    Think of all the people that don’t even know what we know.  So many people are trapped with compulsions, depression, anxiety, addiction - and they don’t even have access to the proper diagnosis.  They get a religious text and a bottle of alcohol.  That’s life for most humans.    And we call ourselves civilized."
turquoiseturtle01,5,Lately I have been having obsessive thoughts about things I own or have ordered in not the best condition. I get really anxious because it’s hard to see things break that I use and have memories from. I get obsessive thoughts of what they looked like before in better condition and the images of the damages also get into my thoughts. My mind starts to wander of how those things can or can’t be replaced. I also start to cry because the obsessive thoughts really get me frustrated and sad because I try to get those thoughts out but they keep coming back. Anyone here feel the same way about things getting bad condition?
Elusive-Yoda,25,"I'v been deeling with pocd for few weeks now, as you may gues its pretty awful, and despite the fact that i know deep down i would never hurt a child my ocd still finds a way to play between the lines.  But i realized something, ocd feeds off of attention and the more i try to argue with it the more it will show up.  I can't say that my pocd is gone yet but it doesn't bother me as much anymore, when it pops into my head i'm like ""ok whatever"" and i move on to doing what i was doing instead of focusing on it.  i hope this can help other pocd and ocd sufferers in general in this sub.  good luck."

turquoiseturtle01,5,These past few weeks I have been having obsessive thoughts about books. I already ordered a lot of books from Target in paperback. I still want to read the books in paperback but also very nervous about book damage when they get delivered and how long the paperback books will last. I am also debating if I should return those paperback books from Target for hardcover books to last longer. I have recently been going through a lot of obsessions of the conditions of things I own and buy and very concerned about how long they’ll last. Would it still be okay to own both copies in hardback and paperback?

I’m scared because my brain switches to “what if you’re lying to yourself and your therapist?”. I’m so scared of these thoughts I don’t like them, but II’m too scared that I might be in denial or somethibg. Please somebody just put an end to me, these thoughts are horrifying. I don’t trust myself, I ca even go outside because I can’t be mear kids. I’m so scared of these thoughts, I can’t hear or see akid because these thoughts come into my mind and I get horrified. I’m so scared of these thoughts, because they feel so real. What if it’s not OCD? I’d rather be dead than be one even if it’s a non offending one. I don’t like these thoughts, please I can’t do this anymore. I get flashbacks from a black mirror episode in which the guy was kind of in denial of being one, and I get horrified because I start comparing myself to that. Please I don’t like these thoughts, they scare me. I’m constantly checking myself to see if I’m aroused or something. I can’t deal with this. Please I’d rather be dead.

turquoiseturtle01,5,"Hello, I’m still new to this Reddit. I have been diagnosed on the Autism spectrum when I was in sixth grade. I did not know what that was at the time. I had so many special interests as a child like Legos, movies, and arts and crafts. I also sometimes struggled in social issues and had so many struggles with math.   As I got into college, I had more of an understanding of my Autism but also noticed certain things that affected my mental health. The pandemic has really taken a toll on that. A lot of my focus on college declined and lost a lot of interest in the hobbies that made me happy. I also felt so isolated at home during the pandemic. It got to a point too that even when restrictions decreased, I still wasn’t ready to go out in public and socialize much.  I still have not been diagnosed with OCD but noticed a lot of OCD like symptoms that developed this summer.   I had a personal traumatic experience recently that caused me to have a lot of mixed emotions and habits. I was constantly thinking about things I used to do and own as a child. These were causing obsessive thoughts and images that would come out of nowhere during days and nights. It was extremely stressful and annoying. I was also obsessing over the conditions of things breaking and getting old.   I kept trying to figure why I was thinking that way and how I could get rid of those thoughts. I was hoping to see a therapist but unfortunately there was a 200 plus people on a waiting list. Also a therapist I used to see retired. I did have a lot of conversations with my mom about my thoughts and it felt good to talk about it. I also had to try to limit certain distractions that caused obsessive thoughts and try to be more productive at home. An improvement made is that I have been praying and having devotionals which has lessened my obsessive thoughts. I feel a lot better and have to try not to get too obsessed with my past and things I used to own."
turquoiseturtle01,5,I just received a new book today from Amazon in the mail. I put it right away on my bookshelf and it was shipped in pristine condition. I went to look at the book and noticed a bunch of fingerprints on the back cover. I think this might’ve happened because I didn’t notice that my fingers were sweaty. The fingerprints are really noticeable because the back cover has a black background. I was disappointed because since it’s brand new and I’m really careful with books. Is there any safe ways to remove smudges/fingerprints without ruining the book?
pleaseimconfused,21,"hello. i have pocd, then some themes of ZOCD, contamination and real event plus somatic  there’s one song i used to like which triggers my OCD so severely now but there’s one line in the song which really resonates with my experience currently and i tried to take it and use it as a way to relate / cope and distract myself from the severely graphic and triggering thoughts i have whenever i even think of the song. plus it was also kind of punishment because i started relating that line to all the people who i may have hurt.  well, now i feel totally invalidated by my own brain because no matter what i do the thoughts won’t go away, and this makes it feel like i’ve used my illness as some quirky fun thing when in reality i can’t stop punishing myself  i miss whoever i was before this pandemic hit, my mental health regressed so much and ruined me in a time where i was actually working on recovery.  i had ocd since i was a kid but it is so severe now that i don’t want to go outside and i can’t think of anything or focus.  i am tormented from the time i wake up to all my day to day tasks to going to bed and talking to people. i want to fucking shut myself in my house and keep all the blinds closed forever. i never want to interact with a single person again. i can’t even get peace asleep. i have headaches and i’m scared to make eye contact with people now.  i don’t have any hope left, i want to die."

purple07631,15,"I'm sorry. What I just posted is about covid-19. I'm talking to my best friend because of that covid-19. I've decided to meet my best friend in person. (He's a very busy person. My best friend is a really busy person with a lot of work to do regardless of covid-19). But in my country, the government is asking me to stay at home. I decided to break the rule and meet with him. There are really many reasons for us to meet. And this decision is not right. But if I don't meet with him now, I don't know what my best friend's plans are in the future. (Because I'm very busy with my work.) It's a painful decision, and I choose to take the higher risk. But I chose the one with the least regret. Some people say they will meet again someday, but I found out a year ago that my friend had actually passed away. I regretted many things. I should have talked more. I should have done that. I should have done this. It's certainly risky to meet in person now, but I'll choose the less regretful option. I'll also take precautions against infection. But I'm really scared if I get it.

SlipInternational593,47,"Hi guys, I have been feeling really depressed and hopeless because of my false memory OCD, which makes me doubt if I have harmed someone 11 years ago. It has come to a point where I'm believing I am in denial of the crime that I've committed, or perhaps I have dissociated and forgot/suppressed the memory about the crime that had taken place. Ive decided to go to the police to confess, although I am really not sure what to expect. But I'd rather they investigate and arrest me than to live with this guilt forever. But then I have this worry that I might be manipulating the people around me to believe that I only have OCD and not something insidious that I have committed.   What should I do, guys? Are such obsessions normal? It is so scary that the obsession hardly budged at all. I wish I can just change themes.  I think I can never recover from OCD. It's just too hard - I sincerely believe I have the scariest/worst OCD content. Just kill me because I'd rather die than to put up with this false memory for the rest of my life! Why can't I just accept the uncertainty and simply move on? My entire potential is wasted on this fucking repetitive thought accusing me of having done something wrong."

It was causing so much stress that I kept imagining pictures and thinking in my head of the damages on the DVDs. I had a hard time sleeping at night too because thoughts would invade my dreams.  The only thing I could do is to move all the DVDs into storage bins with lids so that they aren’t viewable. I got a big storage bin to stack all my DVDs in for my room. A few times I had to keep checking that the DVDs were stacked straight. It worried me a little bit because I didn’t want the DVD cases to get damaged. I also went to put some DVDs stacked by the TV in the living room in a big drawer so they don’t become a distraction while watching TV. Eventually the DVDs in the big storage bing were moved from my room to a guest room because I kept checking on the DVDs.

turquoiseturtle01,5,"Through May and June, I started getting obsessive thoughts about things like VHS tapes, DVDs, yearbooks, video games, Fitbits, and Ipods I used to have from my childhood. I also couldn’t stop thinking about the condition of things I own that have screen and disk scratches and books starring to rip and unstaple. Those obsessive thoughts would just pop in my mind at random moments and I kept missing and picturing childhood memories.   I would feel so exhausted and it was hard to sleep during  the day and night  because the  past thoughts would even appear in my dreams. I noticed too that when I was having obsessive thoughts about my childhood, my head would get cold headache pressures on the left side of my head. I was crying almost every night because of how miserable the past thoughts were making me feel. There was even a few times where my stomach was aching from the stress and didn’t eat much.  I was constantly missing the VHS tapes I donated awhile back. I would constantly picture the VHS cases &amp; tapes in my mind. I eventually went to check my shed to still see if they were still there but no. There was some VHS tapes still saved in a bag but a few of the tapes were damaged from the VCR eating the tape roll. I was so upset that my favorite VHS tapes were gone &amp; that is never get to see them again. It got to a point where I was adding replacement VHS tapes from Amazon, EBay, &amp; Etsy to the carts but realized not to order them to save money and since the VCR doesn’t work.   I was constantly thinking about getting the movies I had on VHS but on DVD. I kept making notes on my phone of the ones I remembered. I was picturing in my mind the DVD covers. I ended up ordering most of the DVDS from Amazon, Target, &amp; Walmart. Most of the DVDs came in pristine condition in the packaging except for some that came damaged or were opened in correctly. I opened up a DVD incorrectly &amp; ripped the plastic sleeve cover that hold the cover art on the spine of the case. I was completely frustrated that I accidentally opened the DVD with the factory seal the wrong way. I was constantly picturing the damage made on the sleeve and tried taping it up but still didn’t look good. I ended up getting a replacement and opened it carefully without damaging it. Some other DVDS came in with dents on the front of the cases with plastic coming off on the DVD opening from Target. I easily got those replaced with no damage. Also some of the DVD disks came lose within the case and was worried about scratches but opened up the cases to put them back in. The disks ended up not being scratched.   There came to a point where I got too overwhelmed looking at all my DVDS. Whenever I would try to watch TV, I would get stressed and distracted over the amount of DVDS stacked on the shelf underneath the TV. I had to figure out a way to store the DVDS in a way where I couldn’t see them. First, I ordered a small storage bin from Target to put the DVDs in. I stored the small bin with DVDS in my room but then the DVDS started to crowd so I ordered a bigger storage bin. With the bigger storage bin I had more room to stack the DVDS without seeing them. There was a few times while sorting the DVDS I noticed the cases had names initialed with Sharpie and scratches on some of the disks. Those two things really bothered me since I take good care of my DVDS and almost thought about replacing those ones. I ended moving the big storage bin of DVDS from my room to a guest room so I don’t get tempted to watch and reorganize the DVDS."

First couple questions that come to mind is, why I'm I trying to find a label?   I'm I actually attracted to two genders or just one.   Why is gender dysphoria actually a thing? My brain is connecting masculine traits to straight sexuality and feminine to gay label. When clearly everyone is unique and sexuality is very personal and deep.  Looked up questioning my sexuality one day and it came to ocd and lgbt community. Sexuality can't be a mental illness, doubting your sexuality is normal so how is ocd even a excuse to why I'm doubting my orientation.   Can people live their whole life doubting their sexual identity?   If so I'm going to commit suicide, I need my identity in tact to live and be confindent in who I am.

Can’t watch TV without thoughts. Can’t go for a walk without thoughts. Can’t do anything without thoughts making me feel the urge to perform compulsions.  People who use OCD to describe their quirky organisation make me sick. How could you wish one second to suffer from that stupid disorder that ruins everything.

pleaseimconfused,21," Hello, I’m 17f. I am diagnosed with OCD and ADHD.  I was at getting groceries. My pocd was lower and I was kinda happier about it, as in I was thinking about how I felt more calm right before this happened.   I was standing in line then I got a feeling to move my butt (as in straighten my posture and tense my butt , idk why). I was slouching and i wanted to take up less space.  my posture was kinda fucked & then i have a fear that there was another part telling me to do it so that my a$$ could look good. i have an issue with hypersexualizing myself.   I noticed a teenage looking girl behind me. At least I thought she was a teenager and she was also shopping alone like me, I guess that made me feel more comfortable and less anxious. I was NOT attracted to her.  When I tensed my butt, immediately after I got this fear that I sexually exposed myself and that I was being a predator and trying to do something bad. Actually the reason why i first did it was to fix my posture i think but i’m scared, what if I had sexual intentions? The second after I did it I got this wave of anxiety saying that i’m being sexual in the presence of kids and that tensing my butt to both fix my posture and to look better means i’m a predator.   I’m scared because what if that means I’m a P_do, I was wearing long jeans.  I either wanted to show off HOWEVER I genuinely can’t remember due to the fact right after I felt really sick and uncomfortable and with the thought “did I expose myself indecently, did I do something to seduce someone, am I a sexual deviant and what if that girl behind me is much younger”.   I wasn’t sexually attracted to that girl behind me either, I thought she was pretty (tbh i’m saying that to be nice and polite but she had nice hair i guess)   People say it’s your actions that make u a pedo, did I act in a bad way. I’m scared and no I did not feel anything good or sexual after doing it it made me feel like a predator. I’m scared there’s a possibility that maybe I did it to show off or because I felt comfortable. but actually I felt weird after, although I don’t know. I sound super stupid now but none of my thoughts feel coherent at all right now. I’m stressed out, I know realistically no one probably even saw that I straightened my posture nor did they see my butt move but I’m worried I had bad intentions.   Worry: I tried to reason with myself saying that “if u were a predator you would have felt gratification afterwards instead of feeling shame over something which frankly looked and seemed normal considering absolutely nobody would see it anyways”. And then I got the thought “well pedos and predators are defined by actions and intents so what if I had the intention to seduce the girl behind me”  and then I wondered if I was trying to show off. But in the end what I’m scared of is that I did a bad action, and people here always say your actions make u bad. I’m scared,  Worry: with thoughts I can let them pass but now I am getting so much anxiety over this, why did I do it, and why did I feel the need to. I guess part of it could be because I have tendencies to want to always come off as perfect so maybe I was trying to make my posture and all look good. I don’t know, all I remember is my butt was sticking out and I straightened my posture and then I tended my butt and then I had a thought about how no one saw it and how I may have exposed myself and done something indecent and it made me embarrassed and feel afraid. Do I let this go? Now I am living with the fear that I had done something bad."

TW:  the reason i have intrusive thoughts about this theme is because when my sister and i were younger (i was like 8 and she was 5) we experimented and it wasn’t me trying to assert a power imbalance or to abuse her but i unrepressed those memories and i have lots of guilt because of it. i talked to her about it years later and she said she’s totally fine and that she’s not mad, she said she doesn’t remember but regardless she forgives me and that i need to let it go. however i’m scared that i might abuse her or touch her inappropriately again."

pleaseimconfused,21,"hello. so i was looking at art of the Virgin Mary and i saw a photo of someone doing modeling / abstract photography art and although my pocd is still declining i thought “oh my god is that a child” out of fear i was sexually attracted. i thought she was pretty it was not in any sexual way.   i clicked on the photo and i got the urge to check her age because i feared i might have been attracted to her.   then i saw another photo underneath (google images shows related images) and she actually looked like an adult but i still wanted to test myself and see if i could find her age.   then i looked through the photo gallery and it was basically like a big art piece and i thought that she was aesthetically very gorgeous and the art was really nice. then i got the thought “i hope she’s an adult” (although she does look like an adult in those photos) i think this was also intrusive because i genuinely didn’t feel s*xual attraction to her.  anyways moral of the story is that although i only felt an aesthetic appreciation for her beauty, i worry i’m a p*do because i liked looking at the art gallery where she modeled for. someone on reddit told me pdos enjoy doing things that involve looking at kids. it was really cool abstract art and i thought she was genuinely very pretty but i didn’t see it as sexual.    i’m scared even though my initial reason for looking was because i wanted to make sure she was an adult and i was scared of having attractions to a child but since i found her pretty and the art cool does that mean i’m enjoying this? i didn’t get any sexual gratification from it at all, just aesthetic appreciation. am i a creep or something, and does it make me a pedo to have appreciated the art gallery (i only felt comfortable appreciating it after i saw she was older anyways because i don’t like looking at photos of kids, that actually makes me feel really weird)  -   i guess i am learning to distinguish aesthetic appreciation from sexual attraction and that has helped me a looot but now my worries is that even though i tested myself and didn’t find her sexually attractive (despite her probably being an adult)  i’m worried that i enjoyed looking at a child / childlike person and if that makes me a pedo?"

Lizziemaughan17x,12,", I’m 17 never been in a relationship but iv liked a lad for 2 years he’s the only guy iv had feelings for and liked properly but the way I was before the ocd happened is different to how I am now let’s say a year ago if he didn’t meet me I’d be upset if he liked a girls pic I’d cry I’d get upset over the little things now I still like him but he doesn’t meet me he doesn’t really give me the bare minimum so idk if it’s just the fact of he’s not putting effort in that’s making me loose interest or if it’s the ocd but when I get upset over him it’s like something in my head is telling me that your fake crying your pretending to care so it proves your not a lesbian then I’m having the what if questions ,, what if I can’t catch feelings fall in love be boy crazy the way I was before what if I was with someone then we broke up and I don’t feel heart break what if I don’t have any emotions or feelings because ocd has took it away I feel like my empathy is gone aswell it’s just shit and idk what to do"
pleaseimconfused,21,"hello. i’m 17f and yes i am diagnosed with ocd.   i had a weird thing happen to me. there’s this one tweet of mine which keeps randomly getting likes even though it was from 2 years ago.  someone liked my tweet and that prompted me to want to quote my OWN tweet and ask why people were suddenly finding it. that person had an aesthetic profile and i thought maybe they were also on the fandom side of twitter but in the back of my mind i got the thought that “oh you’re trying to prey on them” because they had some anime girl as their profile photo, and also i get urges to check ages of everyone and everything.   the second i got that thought i immediately closed the tweet screen and felt so weird, i felt like i was a predator even though i had no intention to say anything sexual to them or even have a sexual interest in some random twitter person, i didn’t even want to talk to them directly. i don’t know what my actual intention was. is it a good sign that when i felt uncomfortable i backed off? this sounds so stupid and i think i am probably overthinking everything especially because i wasn’t trying to contact them or anything, every single situation in my brain now is associated with being a p*do. i don’t even like talking to other teenagers now   this happened maybe an hour ago and i’m still panicking even though i didn’t do anything bad technically? but my brain keeps questioning what my intention may have been over something so dumb  EDIT: okay this is so dumb in retrospect because in reality the thought about childlike things being associated with someone who i don’t even know was probably an intrusive thought trying to scare me, and in the end i still had a compulsion to check ages which means this is also probably part of my ocd. i didn’t do anything to hurt anyone and whenever i get the slightest fear of doing something creepy i feel guilt and disturbance"

pleaseimconfused,21,"i am panicking so much. i am 17 and female.  reading a tweet and i didn’t see their profile photo and then as always i worried if it was a kid and even before i could properly process it i got a feeling of false attraction, then i became panicked and tested myself, these feelings aren’t comforting they come with worry.  then i just felt this compulsive urge to keep checking and checking, i kept worrying that it meant i’m a p*do, and i didn’t feel anything most of the time but it still kept bothering me. i can’t stop looking and replaying events and trying to replicate the thing to see if it’s really false attraction or not.  HOWEVER i went to check again one last time and the results are ruining me currently.   NSFW i decided to try those strategies some people recommend where they tell themselves they want to have sex with kids as a way to respond to intrusive thoughts. at first it made me laugh and feel uncomfortable because it was ridiculous but then i imagined myself doing a sexual thing to the kid to test again and i felt a twinge in my private area, and then i freaked the hell out. i’m disgusted because it feels like i wanted it and it was an excuse when actually i did it to prove to myself nothing would happen however this made it WORSE.    i am so scared, does that make me a pedo????? can groinals even happen to cis women? i feel disgusting for even testing myself like that i thought i would not feel anything but i did feel apathetic / anxious but then i got a groinal /:   I WOULD NEVER DO THIS IN REAL LIFE TO A KID BTW i played this scenario in my head because i thought that i would instantly be disgusted and while it was uncomfortable the groinal response made me panic"

pleaseimconfused,21,"hello. this is going to sound SO dumb but please bear with me. i’m 17f and diagnosed with ocd.  i got my wisdom tooth removed and i was watching gauze videos so i could find a way to change mine properly. there was one with a girl who i couldn’t see properly getting gauze in her mouth.   and i had a fear she was underage so i didn’t want to watch it but then i watched it as a compulsion i guess and to see if i was attracted to her. i didn’t feel arousal but i thought she had a pretty smile and nice lips. i can’t tell who she is or her age since i only saw her lips / mouth and jaw.    then i got scared that i was maybe attracted to her and i needed to know her age so i looked at dental records to match her teeth and see if she was around my age or older, and i guess i shouldn’t be a dentist because i cannot tell, and it’s making me anxious. i thought her smile and lip shape was really pretty and cute but i’m scared i’m preying on an underage person.   i feel weird and creepy now. did i give into a compulsion? instead of working to fight intrusive thoughts and accept uncertainty i just amplified them. i would never knowingly be attracted to someone underage so i guess i spent so much time checking to make sure that she wasn’t underage so in a sense that’s... good.. but i’m concerned bc i kept rewatching the video also to check and it feels like an excuse but i genuinely am worried"

If someone out of my family found out, they'd hate me. My friends call me a good person. So does my family. And so does my psychologist. He reassured me that I'm not a bad person, even after I told him about what I did. My brother forgave me many times, but he's still little. And I don't believe them, even if they call me good. Everyone else would definetly cancel me or hate me for the rest of their lives, which is understanable. I hate myself."
pleaseimconfused,21,"hello. before POCD was a major theme for me, it was a fear of incest, i would test myself to make sure i wasn’t attracted to it.  however... when i was either 16 or 17 there was a fanfiction which was really popular in the Stranger Things fandom, and it showed two characters doing sexual things and they were age 16 and 18 i think. however i read through some of it but i ended up not wanting to finish it.   the character in the show was like 14, and the actress was 15/16 in the show but they aged her character up to 16, in my head i imagined her as older and with older features and not like a kid, but i wasn’t attracted to her.. i was attracted to the older character /:.   i feel so fucking disgusted, i had a memory of reading this and i want to die. i guess i read through some of it to make sure i wasn’t attracted to the step sibling incest.   i’m so scared, these were real people although the fanfiction was written about actors who were overage in real life which i don’t know if i knew at the time but i’m disgusted.   i’m glad at least i didn’t finish the whole thing. and it was a really popular fanfiction, but that doesn’t excuse this. it’s really gross and it feels illegal. i don’t know if the fact that i was 17 makes it any better.   i’m 17 and female and diagnosed with ocd"

pleaseimconfused,21,"trigger warning for death and nsfw:   hello. i’m 17f, diagnosed with OCD, ADHD, depression and i have past trauma.   OCD has been present in my life since childhood. i got diagnosed at 13 and have had the signs since grade school.  however, this recent bout with POCD has stolen any will to live i’ve had. i think i read a bad fanfiction months ago and although it doesn’t arouse me currently i’m worried in the past it might have, although i only looked up this thing out of morbid curiosity.   i can’t feel sexual attraction to anything anymore, and almost all my past sexual experiences involved older men. i was extremely hyper sexual and was exposed early to sex and was groomed  many times. however i get constant sexual thoughts about everything even when i don’t actually desire them, it’s like my brain is so dirty minded it turns everything into something about sex even when i’m not attracted sexually to that thing  i’m scared i’m secretly a pedophile and the thought makes me feel like a disgusting menace to society. i don’t want to talk to anyone or be around anyone, i have so much guilt that when i read stories of survivors i have to match up details and make sure i’m not a predator which makes me feel horrible, like i’m exploiting them to ease my conscience.  when my sister and i were younger (i was 8 and she was 5) we sexually experimented. she told me she’s fine over and over again and i apologized many times but that guilt is part of what lead me to the pocd spiral.   everyday when i wake up i try telling myself things will be okay but it’s like i’m stuck in a time loop of inescapable dread and misery. i don’t want to live anymore and i’m afraid i just don’t deserve to be alive. i don’t want to talk to people who care about because i fear i’m secretly a predator and a monster. i’m scared to be around my crush and ever have sex with anyone. i ignore my family because i feel like i am deceiving them and that i’m not the kind girl they thought i was.  i hate sexual intrusive thoughts, my brain feels dirty and corrupted. i wish i never was exposed to sex at a young age, i’m scared it ruined me forever. i want a clean and pure brain back.   i hate being alive and i don’t want to take any chances; living with uncertainty seems impossible, i’d rather be dead and know if i really am a p^do at least there would be one less in the world"
SlipInternational593,47,"Hey guys, in case you are wondering what I have been through the last few months, please take a look at some of my past posts, especially the latest ones. I apologise that I just have no mental energy to revisit those things again by typing them down here in detail. I can be a bit long-winded no matter how much I try to truncate the things I wanna say, so please forgive me for being a burden :((  Thanks for all the love and support guys. I have to be honest that I am not necessarily better today (after yesterday's post). You see, Therapy is super expensive (those without having to wait weeks or months before the next appt) and meds bring about lots of side effects. It's been a long while since I actually feel belonged to this world. I am not optimistic things will get better at all. I really don't mean to be a downer, but I \*honestly\* see no way out, and telling me to manage it/put up with it, and that it will be a part of me forever only makes me feel even more depressed - because many of you (understandably) have no idea how scary and debilitating the content is. But then again, I would try to psyche myself to think that the rest of the OCD sufferers have \*very\* (?) scary content (so as to feel less alone) and I also can't really \*EXACTLY\* feel for them as well. Moreover, they also have other themes which I don't have.  I am now trying to find more support from OCD coaches like Ali Greymond and maybe Mark Freeman. These are the ones who lifted my spirits because they believe in recovery and have walked through the fire. But I will try not to view their content too much as to turn them into compulsions.  One thing I'm super thankful for is the financial support of my church and some close family friends for my therapy (really, it is very expensive...). However, the most disappointing ones are some of those ""friends"" who I expected to offer me some encouragement (given how long they have known me and are very aware of my mental struggles). They simply distanced away from me. They probably think I am too high maintenance. But in reality, all I need is love and their presence. I guess they aren't my true friends after all...  That's all for now folks. I will face another day with the little faith I have that things might get better."

SlipInternational593,47,"A bit of a rant here…  I really want to work on losing weight, working out and be the best version of myself. However, I always feel like my exercise regime always reap no fruit because of all the stupid side effects my SSRI prescription gives that are cancelling out the benefits reaped. I am feeling damn frustrated because of the psychiatrists keep saying things like “oh you will get worse if you are off your meds” or “weigh the pros and cons. Would you rather be anxious or gain weight”.  I am really tired of psychiatrists playing down the side effects of psychiatric meds. Judging from my recovery journey so far it has done nothing but damage to my mental health by making me either have increased anxiety/mental breakdowns or transforming me into a soulless zombie in the day. And all these people do is to tell me to try out other meds. I am NOT a lab rat and the chemical imbalance theory, in reality, is not scientifically supported. It’s just that they have deals with big Pharma to keep us hooked up on these drugs. The attending psychiatrist just keeps downplaying my suffering and invalidating alternative medicines which are proven to help people with lesser side effects (eg. TCM, homeopathy, chiropractic)  Anyway, I’m be done ranting. It is really infuriating because no matter how hard I try to improve myself, it is not showing any positive result (aka not losing weight), and these doctors are all acting aloof from their ivory towers.   PS: this is based off my personal experience. It’s ok if meds helped you. I’m not invalidating your experiences. I’m just thinking if anyone could relate to mine, cuz I’m really jaded being trapped and suffocated in this mainstream healthcare system😔😔😔😞😞😞"

SlipInternational593,47,"Hi guys, my psychiatrist is considering putting me on a new med after Sertraline, which has been making me nothing but terrible and not sure if it’s placebo, but she’s considering Fluvoxamine, Lexapro and Paroxetine. May I know which one are you on and if they are ideal for you? I personally wouldn’t plan to be on these meds for the rest of my life given they all have side effects (that’s another topic for another day) but I just want to tide over the OCD anxiety and depressed feelings for now.   Thanks :)"
tgott1686,28,I have now completed week 9 on Luvox and have been on my current dose for 3 weeks.  I would say I’m only slightly better.  Should I keep waiting to see if it brings my cod and anxiety down more or think about making a switch?  Anybody have good results after 9 weeks.  I’m near max dose.

Elusive-Yoda,25,It sucks
sharksandpickles,45,"I wanna start off by saying that I'm a 14-year old afab. I've felt horrible about this ever since it happened. It's been over a month, I think. I was scrolling through Tumblr, trying to find content of my favorite character from this one series. I scrolled down and found a comic. It was a doujinshi. For some fucking reason I looked at it and there was my favorite character, kissing another character and slowly putting his hands to the other guy's butt (they were both wearing clothes) and I got groinal responses from it. I was only looking at my favorite character, but still, I feel horrible about it. And I took a screenshot of it. I feel fucking horrible about it and I wish I never did that. I did it because I found it attractive. I wanna punch myself so bad because of it. I feel so disgusting and I regret it so much. I feel so bad about it. I also took a screenshot of it because I thought the way they drew his hair was nice and I could've used it as a reference because his canon hair is literally hard to draw for me. It was still so wrong of me. Suddenly it got more sexual. I felt uncomfortable so I stopped reading it. I didn't look at tge other guy, only my favorite character, but it's still really wrong. I didn't want to fetishize them, because I know it's wrong and I don't wanna treat gay men like they're some sort of objects for my own pleasure. It's awful. I deleted the screenshot(s?) the same day later after I noticed how  wrong it is. I felt so bad I couldn't look at the characters the same for a little while and I had a hard time going to sleep. I can't stop thinking about this and feeling guilty. I feel like a horrible person. I can't believe I did such a thing. I sometimes still get groinal responses when I think about the screenshot. I start checking down there. I seriously feel so guilty and wish I never did this. I feel like throwing up. If everyone found out, they would hate me, which is understandable."

SlipInternational593,47,"Just a disclaimer: I’m not trying to undermine the devastation caused by the pandemic and the physical suffering that goes with it. But I just want to say that in my opinion, having OCD is a thousand times worse than having the virus.   Why?  Because for OCD there seems to be no end in sight. The attention given to COVID is way more than that of mental health and illnesses. The suffering of the people with the virus is validated and recognised, but those of us who battle OCD, depression or any other mental health issues often have our invisible (and visible) sufferings cast aside, ignored or even scoffed at. Our cries for help go unheard. If anything, if I can just get COVID and die from it and not experience OCD anymore, I would gladly take it.   Like I said, really no disrespect to those who got COVID or even have obsessive fears of getting any health issues. I wanna say this out of desperation and despair. No matter how much my dad tells me that I can recover, I really hate that I don’t have the faith to believe or claim it. It’s just so tough…"

pleaseimconfused,21,"hello. before all this pocd stuff started (a fear i’m attracted to kids) i found found it disgusting, i didn’t like pedos and i didn’t like little kids either. i was also sexually exploited by many older men when i was 14. in 17 and female.   i am worried because now my brain has taken innocent situations and made me question if i feel attraction to a child or not, including fictional kids. i have 0 desire whatsoever to ever assault a kid, and i also have had crushes on adults and people my age.   however this pocd won’t leave me alone, i hate waking up and i hate dreaming because even in dreams i get nightmares about this that make me wake up and feel disgusted.   like today i was doing online shopping and i saw a wig and thought “oh it’s a cute wig” and there was a photo of alice from alice in wonderland and then i wondered if i sexualized her and then i analyzed her features and felt this heavy weight in my chest. i found her pretty but i didn’t want to do anything sexual with her at all, and then i worried that i found one of her features attractive in that photo. then i kept testing myself. i don’t know what to do.   EDIT: when i was testing myself there was a photo where it looked like they gave her a bigger chest and i quickly scrolled away and then my curiosity kept saying “you should look” so i did and i didn’t feel attraction to her even though they did give her a bigger chest, am i disgusting for taking a look? i don’t know why, i hate myself so much."

pleaseimconfused,21,"hello. i’m 17f and have been dealing with pocd for 4-5 months. i do have a history of physical and sexual abuse. please warning for gore and nsfw and p*do stuff. i’m so sorry, i know this is really disgusting   recently i had the weird thought that if i can think of murdering the characters or hypotheticals i get false attraction to, it can distract me. i don’t even have the urge to kill anyone, but to me murderous thoughts aren’t as bad as being a child predator since ppl can control murder thoughts but being a pedophile only has one solution and that’s dying   at first it was making bile rise up my throat and gore and injury used to make me kinda squeamish.   however.. the problem is that now i’ve started relying on this too much. sometimes i’ll just... let this dark part of my brain mostly take over and it comes up with the most gruesome shit, and some of it disgusts me. i’ll think of murdering myself, cartoon characters, random faces my brain mashed together and only two times real people although i don’t like thinking of real people.  it’s mostly in third person perspective.  i don’t get sexual pleasure or anything from murdering or dead bodies and i remember years ago looking at guro and it disgusted me personally.    TW GORE POCD:   in this scenarios i don’t like imagining under age people without clothes or anything, and i don’t find them or murdering people sexually attractive however my brain will find torture methods one of which was really disturbing and involved an area associated with sex but i didn’t find it sexually appealing. my brain makes this scenarios as wild and gory as possible.  i’m scared in my head that the made up person i murdered and used this method on was underage although i genuinely can’t remember,  i do know i have a policy where i don’t think of underage people unclothed. i didn’t like the thought when it came up so i switched it.  i repeat that once again i didn’t find this sexually attractive and i got uncomfortable so i switched the scenario to me hurting myself instead.     my brain can recognize when i’m uncomfortable and i’ll try to regain control over the scenario and shift it elsewhere. i really am starting to become uncomfortable with all of this and i feel like i’m going to turn into a freaking psychopath. i don’t want to kill anyone but the types of murder methods and detail these thoughts go into are abnormal, although i used to listen to a lot of horror stories and true crime.   i DO NOT want to kill anyone, nor do i want to torture anyone. when i was being abused as a kid i wanted to murder someone and i’m scared that i’m secretly a killer and on top of that a pedophile.  i’m scared that my brain is finding ways to confirm i’m a pedophile but i never had any sexual attraction to any of the kids in these scenario. how do i stop??? i’m stupid. not only do i not feel like killing in real life, i also don’t find torturing kids sexually appealing either.  i am considering suicide, i can’t get through life like this. i am a monster   edit: then i started feeling really guilty and gross, especially because i remembered this case of this girl who was abused and tortured snd i felt horrible for her. idk if my OCD is now going to manifest here but, this is ruining my life. i don’t want to live anymore, i cannot do this. i don’t know what to do and i’m scared if i talk to someone my worst fears will come true and they’ll say i’m a pedophile"

SlipInternational593,47,"*Trigger warning*:   As some of you might already know, I was hospitalised last night for an OD. I’ve had a few ODs before, but this time round it was serious. Like really serious. I swallowed a lot of pills, mostly sertraline and some enhanced paracetamol. Basically the whole of last night I was having very noticeable side effects and I couldn’t sleep. The symptoms persist till now.    Though I was discharged, I still feel really lost and sick. Thanks a lot to those who believe I can recover. Although I kinda feel like some of you are perhaps trying to say hopeful words to make me feel better, I hold onto them like the Bible.   For those who included things like “OCD will never go away” or “Ill just learn to manage it for the rest of my life”, I respect your POV and tbh, there’s nothing I can say to rebut that. But personally, content like these were a lot *huge* blow to me. Ai Greymond says we can recover. Mark Freeman says it is not chronic. But who am I to believe it will *ever* happen to me?! I know how scary my obsession is. Wanna know how scary it is? I’d rather die than to live with it forever, and I proceeded to swallow those pills. I don’t blame you guys. After all, all our journeys are different, and we know for sure that our respective journey with OCD is the hardest we have travelled so far, or perhaps in our entire lifetime.   I just wish to say that I’m truly tired. I dunno what lies ahead of me. The attending psychiatrist in the E room kept asking me,” Do you really wanna die?” If I said yes, they would have kept me for a few more days, and listen to their preaching that meds, despite their debilitating side effects, work (even though they effectively crippled me).  But, to be honest, I don’t think I want to die, and yet I wish to die to put an end to my struggle with OCD.    I really don’t know if I will do it again. Im hesitant to share my OCD content. But at least I hold onto that hope, no matter how faint it is or even if it is *false*, that keeps me breathing every day. Im not sure if that hope will ever extinguish, but I think if it does, that also marks the end of my lifeline."

(Though I have trouble falling asleep now and my body and head feel so heavy)   It’s been hard. I’ve been called out for seeking attention when all I want is to be loved and understood. So maybe yes, to OD might be a way to get the attention of my friends who have been aloof to my day and night suffering. But at the expense of my health. I’m not sure if it is worth it. I’m just not sure if they are my friends anymore. Friendships can be so fragile when tested. The people that understand me (eg. On OCD subreddit) are people who I’ve never met before.   In the end, I’m still left to deal with this alone, while I have broken my parents’ hearts. But all is well.

pleaseimconfused,21,"I am 17f. I also have a history of sexual traumas involving older men.     hello. every time I look at a person I will always be on guard and wonder if I am attracted to them or not and if they have adult like or childlike features. Sometimes I will be expecting an adult in my head but when I look up at them or at the screen they are a kid. I will worry I am attracted to them, when in fact in my head I made them look like an adult. When I look and see they're a child I dont feel any emotion towards them. Is it normal that in pOCD you start seeing childlike features in adults and adult like features in children? I don't like childlike features at all, and now when I am attracted to an adult I worry its because they have a childlike face and if I see a kid I will find adult like features and wonder if I find them attractive.

Lately I've been seeing posts on TikTok where people say stuff like ""oh yeah my rap1st is on TikTok and has 500k+ followers and nobody knows what they've done to me"" and stuff like that... I have never raped anyone and never will, but that made me think. I've done bad things in the past. I have hurt my family members (which I feel awful about) and I'm afraid if my mutuals or friends found out, they would despise me. One of my friends compliments me a lot, calls me amazing etc. But I always tell him no. I can't accept other people's love for me. I don't deserve it.

I hate going to bed too much. Even if I face up to it, people around me won't praise me for this, which is only natural. Sleeping and waking up is a natural part of being human. I can't do it. They don't even understand me. In fact, they wonder about me. I don't want to live. I used to miss my best friend, but now I don't have the energy to see her anymore.

RockyK96,36,I’ve been on this sub for a while and it’s been so great to know i’m not alone and have people who understand to interact with. However theres this sort of push back from other people with OCD whenever someone complains about it being misused where people say “I have ocd and i dont care or mind when that happens.” I think its great that these things don’t affect them but also don’t find it productive when people are upset about our disorder being misunderstood to mention how it personally doesn’t bother you. It’s okay to be upset and bothered that your disorder is not well understood. It’s okay to be annoyed at the random person saying theyre soo OCD because they organize. We have a debilitating disorder and I don’t want people comparing me on the verge of killing myself bc of OCD to them liking to color code. Our feelings are valid.
SlipInternational593,47,"Hey guys, I just want to share something that is in my mind for a REALLY long time. To me, it is so maddening, upsetting and distressing.   I know recovery means different things for different people to me. For some, it is a journey, but for people like me, it is a destination. Whenever I go do my online research about OCD recovery (it is a compulsion of mine), I really can’t stand when certain renowned professionals in the OCD community just put recovery in a really pessimistic way. What’s more is that some of them even urge us to wake up the idea of ever getting better, that it is something that we have to put up with for the rest of my life.   And again, I don’t mean to come off as offensive towards sufferers who define recovery that way. But I don’t think these professionals are doing us any favour by drilling in us all those things. I, for one, fell into a deep depression and have been suicidal ever since. If not for those words, I wouldn’t be in a deeper hole I was already in.   So, unapologetically, I use all the strength that remains in me to *choose* to believe that recovery is possible. For those who want to have hope, please listen to more of Mark Freeman, Ali Greymond, Matt Codde and Robert Bray’s videos, among some others that I’ve missed. Just avoid certain articles by individuals like Fred Penzel and Elizabeth Mcingvale. Especially the former, who just straight up said that OCD is chronic.   I said what I said. Venting ended."
pleaseimconfused,21,"i’m 17f.   hello, i saw a instagram ad on my timeline it was a comic book about middle schoolers. the only reason i even watched the ad was because i thought i could use it to test if i was a p3do. then i saw a fictional girl who looked really pretty on one slide, but i don’t think i felt any sexual attraction, and i kept trying to test it.  to me she looked really young in all the other photos, the one where i thought she looked pretty was where she had her hair down and looked older, but in other scenes she looked like the pills bury doughboy, like a little kid lmfao  i don’t know how to distinguish aesthetic attraction from sexual, however the false attraction feelings feel super forced or uncomfortable or turn something aesthetic into something sexual when it’s not, sometimes i get false attractions without even properly looking at the other person.    i’m scared bc she had red hair in real life i had crushes on redheads but they were all my age or older) it means i’m attracted to her!! i’m not interested in childlike features at all. this sounds so dumb now that i type it out   the funny thing is in the past when i found fictional characters cute / attractive they’d always be the older looking / older ones, i never liked or even noticed the more childish or baby faced ones"

pleaseimconfused,21,"hi! i’m 17f diagnosed with ocd and adhd   although i never fantasized sexually about a kid and instead started thinking about mostly older men / women, when i was a kid (age 8) i remember being curious about genitals and trying to peak at a babies penis, not out of a s*xual reason but out of curiosity more like it. i only tried that once or twice, and it was not sexual at all, i just happened to accidentally see one and think it was really weird looking but then become curious.   i know for sure i didn’t touch them inappropriately nor was it sexual but i recently had this memory flashback and then fears j assaulted someone. i’m scared that the childhood curiosity makes me a p*dophile even though once again i never had pleasurable sexual thoughts about a kid.   in fact i started being attracted to older men and women and remember crushing on much older celebrities and also having a crush on my childhood friend back then. and even now i get turned on by ppl my age or older and usually with mature features and nsfw warning but i like big chests and also bigger dicks, or just more mature and masculine features (i’m bi and i like masculine women too)   additionally i will have constant false attractions convincing me i’m attracted to literally everyone. i used to have fears of being attracted to my parents for gods sake years ago, and now it’s moved onto kids even though i was basically always interested older people ):"

The non-specialists perhaps never even thought OCD can be manifested in false memories... (they might not even know OCD can involve aggressive and sexual content!!!)   Tell me guys, what should I do? Is it the meds that are making me more ill than ever? Or am I just using meds as an excuse to explain the “untreatable” form of my OCD? Help guys. I can’t go on any longer.

I am planning to structure my life so as to give meaning to it. I am seeing a new therapist next Monday (I am worried because I’m not sure if he believes in recovery or simply “coping” with it, the latter of which is not what I am striving for). I am quitting porn and masturbation because of how much they destroyed my life. I am changing my sleep habits. I aim to reach my goals and values in life.    But with all these...   I get discouraged. I don’t know if I’m doing this and ultimately ending at nothing. My previous therapist has told me that OCD will be part of me for the rest of my life, and he wants me to accept that. But I’m not gonna settle for this. Ali Greymond, Mark Freeman and many others recovered. I’m a fighter. But I get disillusioned after being repeatedly told that I will never get over it. Because of this, I once overdosed on benzos.    Please guys. Give me the courage to carry on. Even if it’s an illusion, I’d rather believe it than live in defeat for the rest of my life."

mickNcheez,23,It’s really hard to do exposures for Socd since anytime you talk about it everyone just assumes you are suicidal but I wanted to ask how to respond to thoughts that are like existential along with it like it says “what’s the point in living if you are going to die anyway?” And it ruins my mood anytime I’m feeling good and it feels like I want it and it gets really hard not to respond with a compulsion to argue and say “no” and then give reasons why I don’t wanna die like how do I respond to those intrusive thoughts??

I’m fucking tired and I’m a fucking liability to all my family, friends and society.   I am very sorry to my parents, who love me so much and are willing to sacrifice their all to give me the best treatment available. We are not rich, and therapy here is really expensive. But I thank God that we have the help of some of our close family friends and the church to provide us some financial assistance to tide things through. But I don’t want to owe them anything anymore.   I am very sorry to my friends. I know many of them tried to help me. But I guess they just couldn’t understand and they eventually just left me in the dust. I don’t blame them. Because I reckon it is really exhausting to help a friend who is stuck in his own head.   I don’t know what to do. I used to have so much hope for my future, and honestly right now in my head, I still envision the life I want to live. But OCD just successfully destroyed me at every turn. It tells me that I will never be good enough, I will never be outstanding enough, and I will forever live in its clutches. I don’t think I can trust mental health professionals because my former therapist, who was in the Public Health Servic, has hurt me so deeply. She betrayed me and refused to give me ERP. She left me when I was at my lowest and she had the whole hospital to back her up. I hate her so much.   I am too tired to fight anymore. Because of the cost and infrequency of therapy, I resort to benzos and porn to numb the pain. I am convinced death is the only option to be free from the OCD thoughts. It’s the same old obsession accusing me day and night that I have killed someone eleven years ago, when I was only fifteen years old. The false memories are suffocating me to the point that my life is not worth living anymore. I think my OCD type is rare, and therefore untreatable. All these professionals are saying I have to put up with OCD for the rest of my life anyway. In this case, I absolutely see no point in trying and pushing on.  I am defeated. I give up. This time round i see no way out other than to do the unthinkable.   Thinking of it, it’s funny how the people who understand me the most are the ones I have never seen in person. Thanks r/OCD."

The attempt to not have this fear forever (such as eternally feeling shame etc)   I knew this before watching the video. I believe my core fear is that of separation. Of being truly alone.

mavavilj,40,"Honestly, possibly all discussion around particular symptoms is pointless. Since it's possibly all reassurance seeking (and rumination). It may not be helpful.  Scrutinizing symptoms may not bring you relief. They're a result, not the cause.  Realization of the ""pointlessness"" and burden of your obsessions and the ineffectiveness of compulsions might though. And then letting loose of all ""safety seeking"" behavior. OCD is about trying to conquer things, which you cannot ever have true control over. It's just a pointless mission.  If you agree, then you can join the no-reassurance seeking version:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCDRecovery/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCDRecovery/new/)"

RockyK96,36,I’ve been taking wellbutrin and other supplements that help with increasing dopamine basically and it’s done wonders for my depression but now my OCD is worse. I’m wondering if the increase in dopamine/use of wellbutrin is making me want to do compulsive behavior more (some people with parkinsons take medications that increase dopamine and start having compulsion problems). But also with being comorbid my anxiety and depression sort of tag team and when one gets better the other gets worse so I also wonder if it could just be because my depression has lifted so much that it let me have all tho focus on the OCD.

sharksandpickles,45,"My friends call me kind and a good person and stuff like that, but I've done many bad things in the past. I'm afraid they wouldn't like me if they found out about all of the bad things I've done. This is making me feel horrible, but I don't feel comfortable talking about it to them. The real event stuff have to do with my family and I don't want them to think my whole family is weird and crazy. I feel like a liar, like a two-faced person. I'm fucking tired of this, even though I do deserve it."

I take lexapro, xanax as needed and buspar and while I luckily don’t feel the psychical sick to my stomach, chills, shaking, racing heart effects as much it’s done nothing for the obsessive thoughts. They’re constant and i’ve tried NAC and magnesium and neither did much. My next step is asking to change from lexapro to luvox. I’m also starting ERP soon but was wondering if anyone had anything that helped quiet their mind, i’m honestly desperate for some relief"
NameIntrepid,9,Whenever my stress levels are high and I have bad anxiety I sometimes will smell weird things.. but its almost as if it’s in the form of an obsession or intrusive.
NameIntrepid,9,It’s so weird.. it’s that feeling when ur like damn I had a good idea but I forgot what it was. But it’s happened more than just a few times lmao it’s so weird..
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,anyone else get this? Ocd affects me academically (as well as in other ways) and makes me think that I shouldnt study as im not really studying because I want to but maybe due to my brother who does quite well in school and often encourages me to. I have a suspicion ive had this since I was 11

Lizziemaughan17x,12,Iv had harm ocd for about a month my “ocd” started 6 months ago and it was hocd but now I’m just getting tortured by these images and thoughts of killing someone chopping there body up putting it into bags it all started with the Jeffery dahmer interview now that Iv seen ted bundy edits on TikTok I had a thought what if u was to become a serial killer then edits would be made of you my body feels this urge to pick a knife up so I squeeze my hands and curl my toes I hate it and sometimes I’m anxious sometimes I get the tug of war in my head of ye u really wanna act on your thoughts idk what to do also because of the hocd I don’t feel anything towards a guy Iv liked for 2 years I just don’t get upset over him like I used to before this happened so it’s like Iv lost feelings/emotions/ empathy so because serial killers don’t have empathy What if I’m a psychopath because I don’t get upset over things anymore and I don’t know why I miss my old self I’m just drowning and drained in this Iv got a therapist ringing on the 21st

I’m always ashamed to send my work because of how bad it looks and how many flaws there are. I hate it so much Legit slept 1:30 hour last night because of this and I just want to cry because my assignment seems terrible to me..."
RockyK96,36,"As someone with a self harm related compulsion I find it really irresponsible that i was advised by a professional to slap a rubber band on my wrist and cause myself harm to come back into reality. It’s upsetting how many counselors will give you advice used for generalized anxiety that will just make obsessions and compulsions worse because it validates the thought. I think that other grounding methods should be used if you need a body sensation to ground you even if you don’t have OCD, it just seems like this method could have potential to become more harmful over time for a lot of people."
Lizziemaughan17x,12,I just watch murder docs of ted Bundy n Jeffery dahmer and I’m comparing myself to them they said they had obsessional thoughts and they acted on it so what if I act on mine it feels real I’m constantly looking in the mirror does my eyes look evil do they look like bundys it’s just a loop and it won’t leave my mind I feel like a serial killer deep down it’s like I wanna act on my thoughts but I wouldn’t so it’s a tug of war
Altruistic_System_41,18,Can ocd attack anything
NameIntrepid,9,So I don’t have like physical rituals other than like 1 that I do sometimes but it doesn’t bother me to much.. Most of my ocd is mental obsessive thinking kinda stuff. But do all mental compulsions have rituals as well? Is there something I’m subconsciously doing or thinking that continues my obsessive thinking?
rioboy1985,37,"I know that OCD is OCD, and the content doesn't really matter. However, this type of obsession is hard to overcome as the law is the law. Yet, often OCD takes the law completely out of context.  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/npbvp2)"
Lizziemaughan17x,12,I seen a link on Facebook saying do not watch this video so obviously I clicked on it just being curious and it was of 3 girls stabbing this girl they cut her head off put a cloth in her mouth and it made me very tense like my head hurts from watching it I felt anxiety but now my brains saying maybe u liked it u see that’s how easy and quick it is to kill someone why don’t u do it etc and now the tug of war is in my head again I can’t do this 🙄🙄

poke000,29,"In order to stop an obsession, we need to stop the compulsion.  In my case, the compulsion is ruminating on possible food safety hazards, and sometimes throwing out food just to be safe.  The tricky part about this obsession is that food safety is truly important.  For example, if a can of food has a leak in it, it is no longer safe to eat.  It would almost certainly make you sick because it had been exposed to air.  But what if a can of food only has a small dent? Or what if there is no dent but you know it was dropped or had pressure applied to it? In my head, it could possibly have been exposed to air in these cases, and there is no way to know for sure.    I need some sort of rule that I can apply to all ""potential"" food safety risks-- a rule that I will only worry about it (take action) if it meets a certain criteria, but I don't know what that criteria should be.  If it's too loose, I could end up giving myself food poisoning.  If it's too rigid, I'll end up controlled by my fears.    My diagnoses: OCD, autism spectrum disorder"
NameIntrepid,9,It’s gotten to the point where I can’t differentiate my regular train of thought from my obsessive thinking. Whenever I have a normal thought I just feel like it’s obsessive and it gives me anxiety. Hate this shit so much.
Lizziemaughan17x,12,Iv had “ocd” for nearly 6 months it all started with a hocd thought now my main theme that’s bothering me is harm / fear of becoming a killer and acting on those thoughts etc but I just don’t feel happy I miss how/who I was before this happened is it possible to go back to how we was before ocd it’s like I’m a different person I just miss everything yano it’s like Iv took life and my normal brain for granted 🤷‍♀️😓

Infinite_Tax_6567,3,"So this has been affecting me for  a while now and recently I found out I might have ocd so idk if this is due to that or something else like impostor syndrome, so basically if I think that something I achieved is due to other things like if I wanted to revise for an exam but I thought maybe I only got that idea/motivation to revise maybe due to my brother who is academic so I wouldnt revise. Anothe thing is im growing out my hair and my dad started speaking to me and then I thought of how I was going to shower and I felt that im only showering because of my dad."
Lizziemaughan17x,12,My theme at the minute is harm ocd but apparently u get sensations and feelings in your body with it so because of the harm thoughts I’m getting a feeling in my stomach like a stab sharp feeling is that apart of ocd or not ?

I don’t know how much therapy and medication can or will help after trying different things on and off for like 10 years. I’m in my mind every second and i’m so exhausted and irritable and fed up. I literally don’t know which of my thoughts are true or not I can’t trust my self or my “intuition,” any time i turn to a higher power to give me hope ocd just tells me im insane for believing any of it then i’m back to being miserable.

Lizziemaughan17x,12,For the past month maybe Iv been having harm thoughts about killing someone it started when I seen a short clip of Jeffery Dahmer on TikTok then I decided to watch the whole thing on YouTube then the thought came in what if u was gonna kill someone because he pacifically said he said obsessions and thoughts so now it’s like I keep watching the docs and my brains saying do it see what it’s like sometimes I get anxiety sometimes I don’t I just want it to go I feel like I won’t be able to love anyone because of the hocd it’s like my feelings have gone for everyone so what about if I have a child what if it’s born and I feel nothing towards it and Iv gotta fake my love to everyone

Lizziemaughan17x,12,I watch serial killer interviews and they say they had obsessive thoughts which scares me because what if my mind is turning like that whenever I see a bin bag I think oh ye body parts could go in there it’s constantly in my head I don’t feel comfortable standing in the kitchen for too long either I just want this to go it feels so real that I wanna act on my thoughts what if my minds like a killers idk if it’s ocd or if I’m really a murderer but I haven’t acted on it it feels like I want to do it omg

I want to know, in recovery do you feel like your mind is ""strong""? What do you feel like? Do you feel ""normal""? Can you live a normal life without the things that would have before bothered you bothering you?   I appreciate any of your comments.  Cheers, Ben"
Sommet_,22,"Hello  I’m about to be kicked out. I feel so alone right now. I feel I can’t talk to anyone. OCD is messing with my mind, memory, it’s mentally draining me. I can’t trust anyone. I was never like this 5 years ago. I’m not normal for society. Many days I just feel like I want to end it but something inside me says to wait. I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this. Every single year gets worse and worse I going to be pushed over my limit. Nobody has or will understand me. I get yelled at for something I can’t really control. This is ridiculous, I can’t live like this. I’m rock bottom and I don’t know what to do. I try to do something right and can’t do anything. I feel useless. Was this whole thing inevitable? I told myself the only person to trust is yourself. Love yourself. But I don’t know."
rioboy1985,37,"I'm terrified of intimacy. I'm terrified of getting with a girl as when I do I imagine I've done something with her in the bed, committed some sort of sexual crime. I ask ""did I do anything you didn't want?"" ""Was it OK I did this/that?"". Then the girl says ""yes, it's all good"", but my mind kinda goes blank and I can't accept that she said ""yes, it's all good"", so I ask again ""what did you say?"", then this process goes on and on asking the same questions over and over thinking I'm a criminal.   The girl starts off like ""it's OK, you can ask as much as you want"", but after a few days or weeks they usually get angry and lose attraction to me. I'm a tall, 35 year old handsome man, but I can't hold down a relationship. The girl knows that I'm nervous and I can't perform, as I'm so terrified. This girl that I'm seeing is in love with me but I need to end it as I can't relax. I feel so alone. Lots of girls are interesting in me but I'm so afraid of letting them in, and that's when my OCD goes into overdrive"
tgott1686,28,"Luvox question  Hi I’m a 34 m and have taken celexa for 12 years for intrusive thoughts and anxiety.  It worked wonders until it seemed to poop out on me recently.  I started Luvox 5 weeks ago.  First week was 50 mg, 2nd week was 100mg, 3rd week was 150mg and the last 2 weeks was 200mg.

Lizziemaughan17x,12,So earlier it’s like my body had these weird sensations and I had the urge to act on my harm thoughts so I sat down and started squeezing my hands really tight and curling my toes up I don’t know it’s weird is that normal is it apart of ocd idk
mickNcheez,23,Like I have self harm/suicidal ocd and at least if the worst happens for other themes y’all will still be alive like people say all the time like “oh if it happens it happens” yea easy for u to say if mine happens I’ll be dead bro smh
RockyK96,36,"i think this stems from my social anxiety, i hate the uncertainty of not knowing what people think of me or where I stand with them. If someone deletes me on socials or something similar i come up with all kinds of conspiracies about myself of why they did. I’m scared of people having the wrong impression of me and what they say behind my back so i reassurance seek to others about it. DAE struggle with something similar or have advice?"
Lizziemaughan17x,12,"So iv had hocd for 5 months and my brain got used to it, the first month was hell crying everyday I couldn’t eat or sleep I felt dead inside but anyway I feel like I can’t be in a relationship because I’m left with these thoughts and doubts because what if I’m faking it what if I can’t catch feelings and feel the crush feeling I did with boys before iv lost feelings for someone iv liked for 2 years so how am I supposed to be normal ?? Also with harm ocd aswell when I’m pissed off it’s like I feel this volcano building inside and about to irrupt I feel so angry like I get shaky and I never used to be like that but over the tiniest thing i just get angry quick so I get scared because what if I snap and pick up the nearest thing near me and use it on someone"
sharksandpickles,45,"So basically I have this thing when if I have a really bad intrusive thought, get groinal responses or something bad just happens, I can't watch a specific anime/cartoon/tv show on that day. I have to wait until the next day, so the experience will be ""perfect"". This sounds pretty dumb and probably most likely isn't related to ocd but I wanna make sure."
sharksandpickles,45,"I'm pretty much shaking right now and I can't sleep because I commented on someone's Tumblr post and realized how stupid I sounded. I'm scared I may have made them uncomfortable and I'm gonna be ""cancelled"" and hated by everyone for the rest of my life. My comment is still up, you can't delete it. Great. I wanna apologize to the person but they probably hate me already. What do I do? I blocked them and completely changed my profile but my comment is still up, other people can see it. Why am I even obsessing over this so much."
mickNcheez,23,My biggest fear right now is death and that I won’t be around to see the future and it’ll all be my fault. My worst scenario is that I’ll go to treatment for self harm thoughts and that we can’t come up with a reason for me to live! I’m so paralyzed with fear recently that something bad will happen! What do I do?!
pleaseimconfused,21,"bruh this is so stupid but i feel the need to confess. i’m tired.   there was some dude sitting in the chair in front of me and i vaguely glanced and saw feminine looking ppl was like “huh why is he looking at hot kpop girls in class” but then i took a moment to focus my eyes and they were actually photos of random little girls?! now i’m freaking out, i didn’t even properly focus on the pictures and now i’m back to being scared that i’m a p*do. the second it registered my heart started beating and i felt disgusted. i didn’t even recognize or register that they were kids my eyes just vaguely grazed past his screen.   what does any of this mean. for context i’ve been plagued with pocd thoughts for a few months. i’m afraid that my pocd is turning me into a p*do..  this thought keeps targeting me, my brain didn’t process the images properly snd when i did i can’t let go of my initial uneducated reaction . i don’t know, i saw vaguely feminine looking photos and instantly assumed he was looking at pretty adult girls."
RockyK96,36,I feel like since I have so much anxiety about how I’m perceived by other people that I think I compulsively post to try to control the narrative. I can feel myself being annoying on twitter but just wont stop. I try to delete the app but then just impulsively re download it. I try to use blocking apps but just find the ways to work around them. I am starting ERP soon and discussed this with my therapist but does anyone have advice?
rioboy1985,37,"It turns out that nearly every Sunday is hell for me. I know usually that when I wake up I'm gonna be tired and anxious. So today I woke up very late, nearly 1pm. I usually get up at around 7.20am during the week.  Today I woke feeling anxious. You know that feeling where you don't have any specific OCD thoughts, but could be triggered at any moment? Well, that happened. Just soon after I was talking to a girl who has a lot of issues, but is mad about me. She started scrutinising my life, trying to understand me and asked if I was schizophrenic etc. For someone with OCD that's a tad problematic. So that set me off  However, I had to force myself to leave the house and ride my bike. I live in Rio de Janeiro in front of Sugarloaf Mountain. You can Google it. It's beautiful. I feel some relief getting out. I think this is why it's so important to refocus. Don't engage with the content of the thoughts, as I learned from Brainlock and Overcoming Unwanted Intrusive Thoughts, two excellent books.  It's now 18.13. I feel the anxiety, but I'm trying to let the thoughts just be there, and refocus (I'm gonna watch a cool series on HBO).  So, often I can predict an OCD episode, mostly when I've no work that day. I was encouraged by a post from 8 months ago about a guy showing on a graph his journey to recovery. I'm on my journey. I want rid of this beast and to be in control of my life  Normally I feel agitated and wanted to be alone when I have an OCD episode, normally accompanied by fear. But when it's really bad I feel sick, so afraid and nauseated maybe. How do you guys feel when you're having an OCD episode? Share your thoughts please  Ben"
NameIntrepid,9,"So sometimes I’ll worry about whether or not I’ve gone insane from my ocd. Which like I understand why I feel that way because the amount of stress it causes me. However, sometimes I’ll subconsciously like convince myself I’m going insane/crazy. I’ll have this weird ‘vibe’ like feeling that makes mr feel as if I’ve gone insane. It’s really weird, I’ll start to feel off, stutter when I speak, I don’t even feel like myself at all. I can’t identify myself with things I normally like or enjoy. Idk its just frustrating and I want to feel like myself again :(."
Lizziemaughan17x,12,so basically yesterday I was at a party I was smoking weed drinking just having a good time but when I was in the kitchen I seen a block of knives so I got anxiety and I went back in the garden then my mood kinda dropped and I was having all these horrible thoughts of just kill them just kill them then everyone was playing a kissing game and people was grabbing each others necks and I just thought of strangling someone which made me anxious but I carried on with the night and today I feel okay the thoughts of harming someone didn’t really bother me maybe it’s because I finally went out to socialise after 5 weeks of staying in cuz I think staying in had made it worse so iv just gotta keep busy however I did kiss like 2 boys but I didn’t feel aroused uno the feeling u get when there’s something sexual going on I didn’t feel anything down there or in my body so I’m thinking why didn’t I feel turned on what if I can’t get into a relationship catch feelings fall in love and be normal because it’s like I’m “faking” it idk
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,"So I’ve had this thing roughly since 11yrs old and basically I can’t seem to be able to except help with certain things, like for example even in the tiniest things like if I told a funny joke and then thought that outside factors helped me then i if I texted the joke I’d delete it. Also if I was revising for an exam and someone told me to revise like my parents or I revised but didn’t think I’d revised due to me actually wanting to revise then I wouldn’t. Idk if this was down to ocd or just a pride thing hopefully this makes sense"
SlipInternational593,47,"I know I have a lot to offer to this world. As an individual, I am eloquent, inquisitive, creative, empathetic, and outgoing. I have also been described as an intelligent individual with a strong sense of self-awareness by my previous therapist who specialises in OCD treatment. But all these have been severely stifled by my Ocd intrusive thoughts that are bombarding me 24/7 (yes, sometimes during my sleep as well). Then, depression came into the picture. It has been a few years since I actually felt “normal.” I understand “normal” is an illusion, but you guys know what I mean - I want to be a functional, productive member of the society, and it is incredibly devastating to be fully aware of what hinders the realisation of such a goal and yet helpless in face of it. Now I am just a person with constant bodily aches as well as an astounding weight gain that seeks to further demolish whatever self-esteem that is left within me.    Sorry for the rant, guys. I always feel I’m a liability to my family, friends and society. I have been ticked off for seeking reass****** (I don’t want to type the full word since it will be flagged by the system) in my posts, when in fact, I just need someone to tell me that I’m really not alone - ocd is a freaking isolating condition. I will think things like “oh, that person managed to recover, but it will never happen for me.” The pandemic has everyone anxious about their physical health, and yet when it comes to mental health many just turn a blind eye towards it. It is as if my mental suffering is invalidated because they are invisible.  If I know that I won’t recover in my lifetime, then I am clear that suicide is the only option. Thanks for reading this post, and I hope that currently you guys are truly in a better position than me. I will try to reply to whatever response that is left under this post. But I hope I have the mental reserve to do so.   Peace out..."
Lizziemaughan17x,12,I keep dreaming about serial killers everyday when I wake up my brain goes kill someone kill someone then I get anxiety sometimes I don’t get anxiety but it won’t leave my head it’s like I want to act on my thoughts it feels so real and iv had hocd for 5 months but now that it’s switched to this I wish if I was obsessed with the hocd cuz now I feel like my personality has changed I’m not happy does each theme change u I feel like a different person to how I was last year when I never had ocd but now I feel a different person to how I was a few months ago is this normal and I just want me back omg 🙄🙄

I was so happy before it started/I started having serious symptoms and it ruined everything. I’m just so upset when I realise how bad I have become at just living my life and doing basic actions like studying, going to sleep, grocery shopping,... it’s so sad and it feels unfair  I’m disgusted that some people think OCD is cute, quirky and means being organised. It just feels like having a messed up brain constantly on fire and that’s so tiring"

I mean, I’ve had past obsessions that were along the same old themes of harm and false memory, but none as bad as the current one, which has stuck by me for a decade.   I will always read examples of intrusive thoughts people with Pure O have, and I’ll be like “they are nowhere as scary as mine.” I’m not sure if this is downplaying other people’s experiences but this is honestly how I feel, that my severity surpasses everyone else :/"
Lizziemaughan17x,12,Last night I had a dream about ted bundy then when I woke up I felt anxious and my mind kept saying haha if anyone pisses u off today just kill them like wtf iv also got hocd but idk how to explain it but when the ocd theme changes does r personality change aswell because even tho the hocd started in December the way I felt in jan feb March bits of April it’s different to now I keep saying I wanna go back a year ago to when I never had this but now I just wanna go back to them months because I don’t feel happy anymore I don’t laugh iv lost feelings for someone iv liked for ages I just don’t care about him idk what to feel it’s like this has ruined my life I just wanna be happy I wanna go back a year in my life no one understands 😔!!
mickNcheez,23,I keep getting this weird feeling like a hyper awareness of living and that it feels weird to just be existing! This uncomfortable feeling just won’t go away and it keeps saying that I really wanna die but I don’t!! I keep arguing with it and every time I list reasons why I don’t wanna die I feel weird like it’s not true!! I don’t know how to do exposures for feelings! Help!!
mickNcheez,23,"  My ocd keeps keeping me going back and forth with feelings! Like it’ll be like “you don’t wanna live” and then I’m like caught in the argument like “yes I do because I wanna see this and this etc.” and I definitely don’t wanna hurt myself at all but how do I just let this go when the fear is this one where it’s harder to accept! I’m not majorly depressed and I talked to my dad and he thinks I’m fine, what do I do??!"
mavavilj,40,"Just an idea I've been having lately.  I've struggled long with letting go of compulsions, because I've become accustomed to their relieving effect.  Yet I've noticed that the longer I postpone the compulsion, the better my head truly feels. The compulsion is just a very short-term thing. And doing them reinforces the habit of doing it the next time and next time and next time. I perceive that by doing this you teach your brain ""do this for relief"".  I've started to believe to the idea that the brain will fix itself back to normal, but to do this you may need to stop all OCD habits, in order to not make the brain relearn back to them.  I used to view ""stop compulsing"" as difficult or unmotivational. This observation has made me more believing towards trusting my brain again. That I should trust that there's nothing bad going to happen, even if I don't compulse.  The least that I can do is to try and see, whether my brain reverses the habit, if I stop engaging in OCD behavior."
mickNcheez,23,Has anyone done erp for this theme and what did that consist of? Or mainly any tips that might help?
mickNcheez,23,"I don’t wanna die or hurt myself at all but do y’all ever get the thoughts like “you wanna die!”,” you don’t actually care if people hurt themselves!” “You don’t care if your family would be sad!” Is this just another way for ocd to trick me to answer? I also have like a weird hyper awareness of living right now like everyone around me is living and what does that mean to be alive? I’ve been scrambling all day and I know I just need to accept I won’t know but it’s so damn hard! I already talked to my dad and he thinks im okay and that I won’t hurt myself and im not majorly depressed at all!"
mickNcheez,23,Why do these thoughts have to feel so real sometimes! I don’t wanna kms I don’t so why does it keep coming up over and over! These feelings along with the thoughts suck! How do I get rid of this stupid theme!? I’m not even majorly depressed or anything!
mickNcheez,23,So I’ll just say right now that I don’t want to hurt myself at all I swear! However I’m so scared that it will happen in the future! But does anyone ever get the listing compulsion where you feel like you need to list all the reasons you won’t kys but if you don’t get the right feeling then you get super anxious and feel like it must be true then? Im not majorly depressed at all I’m just worried that maybe I’ll stop caring or something! Ugh this sucks man anyone else have this??
Lizziemaughan17x,12,Does anyone feel like they should act on there thoughts so you’ll be locked away then all this will be over I watched the interview with Jeffery dahmer and he said he had an “obsession” that he couldn’t ignore so what if these thoughts that loop in my head r fantasies of killing someone iv got the whole murder story planned in my head so what if iv got the obsession with killing someone and it’s not an ocd thing cuz sometimes it’s like I want the thoughts idk I just wish I was obsessed with the hocd again because I don’t feel anxiety I generally feel crazy it’s like there’s another person inside of me and there’s these doubts and thoughts
RockyK96,36,"like am i losing my mind? I’m doing irrational compulsions(i think?) to try to cope with it but this feeling is just gnawing at my stomach lately i feel sick. I dont know if i can trust my own feelings or my “intuition”,I try to turn to spirituality but then my brain tells me im psychotic for believing in things like that. I don’t know what to do I dont know if this is a new theme or what but I feel unprepared and super overwhelmed."
Lizziemaughan17x,12,Anyone feel with all the stress depression anxiety harm thoughts hocd whatever it is u just feel like you’ve lost yourself and I’m scared I’ll never be happy or back to how I used to it’s weird because iv had this since dec 2020 but jan feb March and parts of April was okay but this month has been really bad I don’t feel in reality I’m moody 24/7 I feel dizzy and it’s like I feel different to how I did a few months ago when I look back a year ago it hurts to say I don’t recognise myself so have I got a split personality am I gonna turn into a different person each time I’m so tired confused and done with this idk what to do
Lizziemaughan17x,12,I feel moody 24/7 light headed dizzy when I’m talking it’s hard to explain something cuz it’s like my brains not there I can be talking then I’ll accidentally say something weird I zone out I can be in a conversation then I won’t remember anything the persons just said it’s weird why’s this happening I want this to go it’s constant everyday
pleaseimconfused,21,"tw POCD / sexual thing  TLDR: when i was young i saw a baby’s penis and thought it looked weird. i didn’t feel attraction to the kid or the penis but i was curious as to why it looked the way it was and i remember i kept trying to look at it again and being confused at why it looked like that. i’m scared that makes me a monster and a pedo. once again i don’t recall and still don’t feel any sort of sexual attraction associated with the situation but instead curiosity about private parts if that makes sense. like i didn’t think of wanting to do anything sexual then, i just wanted to look at them because they looked weird. i have no idea if that even makes sense      i was diagnosed with ocd when i was 12 or 13 and i’ve had many severe symptoms since before that in my childhood, such as contamination & injury. looking back and talking to my therapist makes me realize how much of my childhood behaviors were rooted in anxiety and ocd.   my culture and parents were sexually conservative and even private part talk was taboo.  i always had normal attractions (as in i want to date people around my age or older). if i like someone younger theyre always only a year younger than me, but i mostly like older people and know this for a fact. i only started overthinking everything in February, before i never felt like i had any attractions to kids or anything and dated normally and even had crushes , relationships and celebrity crushes too.  i remember crushing on older celebrities as a kid so i guess that confirms i’m not a pedo but this one event haunts me.     idk if some of it is a false memory. i know i didn’t touch any kid or even feel attracted to the child, i was just mind boggled by why penises looked like that. i’m horrified at those thoughts years later and now i’m scared i don’t deserve love and that i’m a child molesting p*do.  i’m so afraid, i just wish i was dead right now, i can’t deal with these thoughts any longer. i want everything to be normal again, now i can’t open up to anyone because i’m scared they’ll think i’m a horrible monster, which is what i feel like about myself"
Lizziemaughan17x,12,Especially with the harm thoughts when I’m high I feel so anxious it makes it 10x worse
mickNcheez,23,My brain is constantly ruining things for me cause I’ll worry about dying in the future. I don’t want to hurt myself at all not even a little but I’m scared! What if I do?! What if I never get to experience the future because of it! I know I probably just need to accept uncertainty but it’s so so hard 😭😭
Lizziemaughan17x,12,"It’s like I’m a different person the way I was a year ago I don’t recognise myself and I’m getting harm thoughts iv got hocd aswell but it’s like the way I’m feeling now is different to January feb March , I wake up in a bad mood all the time I’m constantly miserable and I don’t know what’s wrong it’s like I’m a different person to how I was a year ago and a few months ago and I’m thinking what if iv got personality problems"
sharksandpickles,45,"I feel like a fucking monster. Everytime I see other people's posts about their real event ocd, I feel like what they did isn't even that bad compared to what I've done, and it makes me feel horrible. I feel like a monster. I don't wanna exist, even though I deserve this feeling. Everyday I feel awful for what I did and I wish I could just beat the fuck out of my past bitchy self. I should've been hurt instead of me hurting others. What I did was horrible. I should be considered an abuser. I should be in hell."
mickNcheez,23,"I’m gonna start by saying that hurting myself is the last thing I wanna do just to get that out of the way. However, I started off getting an existential ocd theme where it makes it hard to enjoy the things I like without my brain constantly asking questions like “why enjoy this there’s no purpose in life? Or life has no meaning” and then it turned into me worrying ab kms in the future and it scares me so bad like I wanna enjoy my life but it keeps bringing up the idea of my parents being sad at my funeral like wtf?! 😭 I don’t know what kind of exposures to do for this? I’ve been getting ok at the various themes I’ve had before but this ones been kicking my ass lately 😔"
Lizziemaughan17x,12,So I go to the doctors tell him everything then he says I don’t think it’s ocd it might be obsessive compulsive personality disorder so some therapy team rings me and iv got a telephone therapy appointment in 5 weeks ! Then Cams rings me I explain everything then they said maybe u need to speak to a councillor about sexuality problems then they say sorry the only thing iv got is the Therapy team appointment for 5 weeks time so I feel so defeated I don’t know what’s wrong with me
SlipInternational593,47,"I don't know what to do... the last time I shared with my new psychiatrist about my obsession, he said that mine is chronic and ERP won't work. I don't dare to even share it with you guys here, cuz I'm afraid that I will be told that my case is a treatment-resistant one and I am a goner for the rest of my life."
mickNcheez,23,I’ve been worried recently about not having a purpose in life or that I can’t figure out the meaning behind everything and it led me to have the suicide ocd theme too and I in no way want to hurt myself but I’m constantly anxious about it and what if I kms in the future? How can I be happy now if that happens in the future?? What exposures do you do for that kind of thing? Same thing for every other theme?
Lizziemaughan17x,12,It hurts so bad just wanting to go back to how I was before this I feel drained defeated and depressed and I’m scared I won’t be happy and be how I used to I want my old way of thinking back I want the feelings back that iv lost for a boy iv liked for ages I feel like apart of me is gone and I’m never ever gonna get it back it hurts and I’m lost
SlipInternational593,47,"Hi guys,  Earlier this week, I was so devastated by my visit to a new psychiatrist in my area. Just a trigger warning that this might come off as very triggering for some.    The psychiatrist was an asshole to say the very least. It basically shattered all my hopes for a better life and chances for recovery. Let me break down what he said:   1) He said that he was surprised to know that I’m in university as people with OCD rarely even get into universities. That was one of the first things he said when I entered his office.  2) He said that my OCD is very horrendous, given that my obsession has to deal with violent themes. In fact, he also said that OCD with taboo thoughts (the so-called Pure O) are harder to treat than the more “normal” OCD (u guys know what I mean)  3) He said that the manifestation of my themes (harm OCD, false memory OCD) are worse off and scarier than themes dealing with checking and counting. In fact he said that the checking and counting themes *do not* contain fear as opposed to my themes.   4) He said that counselling and exposure therapy doesn’t work for me, as my compulsions are not physical.   5) He wanted to prescribe me tranquilizers, and said SSRIs won’t work for me.  6) He wanted me to seek reassurance from the “right” people...  7) He outright told me my manifestation of OCD is chronic as compared to others.   Basically, he left me even more hopeless than ever. I even contemplated ending my life after I left his office. But my dad through the phone begged me to not do it and come back. I paid $256 for a consultation with someone who has had over 30 years of clinical experience and claimed he knew OCD and yet telling me that OCD involving checking and counting and washing don’t have fear that drive these compulsions. I asked him if these people with my themes of OCD would kill themselves, he kinda implied yes.   Basically, he confirmed that I’m the worst and most fucked up person with OCD. I completely broke down after that. I’m not sure why he would say all these things - it’s as if he’s just intentionally trying to devastate me. I’m so hurt by these mental health professionals there’s no words I can describe my hatred towards them."
mickNcheez,23,What do I do?? Just accept uncertainty I guess with maybe it will maybe it won’t? God I feel like I’m spiraling tonight this sucks! I think I need some water and some good sleep but I’m so worried man 😭
mickNcheez,23,Like I will do something nice or “good” and then my brain will be like “you don’t actually care you’re just doing it cause you want to cover up what a bad person you are!” Like how fucked up is that? Ugh!!
carter_pride,46,"Everything I ever did was me trying to run away from phobias, fears, anxieties, and trauma.  Every decision I ever made was driven by avoidance.  There is no real me.  I was nothing but a bunch of tics and compulsions.    I wasted my whole damn life away, and now I don’t know what to do.  I just feel like crying.  It’s too late to start over."
sharksandpickles,45,"Everyday I remember the way I hurt my brother over a year ago. Physically. I had anger management issues, but that doesn't excuse anything. Hitting someone multiple times in a row is basically beating. I deserve to die. My brother deserved better. He's not afraid of me, he still wants to spend time and play with me... but I'm a monster. I shouldn't be around him. All I want is to be an adult and move away as far as I can and live alone for the rest of my life. But escaping won't fix anything. If my friends found out about what I did, they would hate me. I'm tired of this. But that's what I deserve. I hope I get the karma I deserve."
mickNcheez,23,Like does it ever ask like “do you think this is bad? Why do you think it’s bad or why is it bad?? And then I feel like I’m compelled to answer and reason with it like “it’s bad because of this this and this” I’m just curious if y’all have this or not?
Lizziemaughan17x,12,So first it was hocd then trans thoughts then harm thoughts now it’s pocd and I haven’t done this Ik this is discusting but I feel mental it’s like my brains telling me to search child porn but I haven’t done it and I don’t want to is that normal I’m seeing a doctor next week and hopefully going into therapy 😓
Lizziemaughan17x,12,"it’s like I want to act on them like my brains saying just do it to see what it’s like but ik I won’t do it but it’s like I want to I’m scared that I’m a bad person or i could act on these things ,, idk if it’s cuz I’m watching to many murder docs or horror films and listening to serial killers explaining how they wanted to know what it felt like to kill I don’t feel anxiety anymore I’m just numb with all these things but I’m just questioning myself idk how to explain it 🙄☹️ I’m scared"
Lizziemaughan17x,12,"Add my socials Lizzie6677 , Lizziemaughanx._ if anyone needs to talk about anything any thoughts any ocd theme"
NameIntrepid,9,I focused way too much on my ocd to the point where I can’t tell the difference between my real thoughts and the obsessive thoughts. I can’t figure out how to feel like myself anymore. I feel so lost inside my head it’s just so scary :(. Is this normal at all? It’s so frightening how real it feels..
DangerousFee4,38,"I'm a guy in my 20s with server ocd and anxiety, had it my whole life. Don't have any IRL friends , I'm seeking friendships online , we can chat every day. I've been extremely lonely and becoming suicidal. Ive accepted my reality , Im servely mentally ill. I need support from others, to get thru the days.    I'm a nice guy , geniune and can talk about anything. I like deep conversations over just causal.   I don't care what gender you are, race, sexual orientation , family status. I just want human connection, conversation with others.   Have a good night everyone.  EDIT: 5/13/21   THANK you for everyone reaching out to me since I posted this last night, I got a overwhelming amount of DMs from people in the community.🙏 I can't thank you guys enough , means ALOT how supporting you all are.

rioboy1985,37,"It's not the K hole, or a black hole, it's the OCD hole.  It's that place that sucks you in until you forget why you're there in the first place.  Many times it starts off with ""if I just take 2 minutes to resolve this doubt in my mind it'll go away"". Then, after 8 hours, no dinner and 20 unresponded messages from loved ones, you're still there, lying in your bed, trying to solve the now 20 other doubts that have stemmed off the original.  This is my experience at least. I get that first doubt, that first need to be resolved. It seems best to do the compulsion, especially if it looks like it'll take no time. But it rarely works that way. The moment you give in to that first obsession and do the compulsion you start a vicious cycle. The worst thing is that it brings you to a very dark place. It steals your hope as you're now caught up in constant feeling of anxiety, fear, and dread. OCD steals your hope. Just when you feel like everything is going right, you give in one time and get sucked into the OCD hole. The more you try to dig yourself out, the more you get sucked in.  I've been reading two books mainly on OCD. ""Overcoming Unwanted Instrusive Thoughts"" by Winston and Seif, and ""Brainlock"" by Jeffrey Schwartz. They both advocate resisting that first urge to do the compulsion. You need to absorb and feel the PAIN and refocus your attention onto something constructive.  I have to say, this is very difficult. I make progress and start to feel normal again, just to get caught off guard, then I fall back into the trap.   It seems for me that the root cause of my compulsions is to escape from this deep rooted fear of being alone. I don't mean necessarily physically alone. I'm more physically alone than I am with people. Rather, I mean to no longer have that ability to be with people when I want, or to have people not want to be with me.  How does this play out? Well, I fear contamination, because if I get HIV people will be scared of me. I fear the law because if I go to jail people will see me as a pariah.  The content of our OCD is very much irrelevant. But, for me, this is the main fear behind all compulsions. I guess I need to accept the possibility of this happening, of being abandoned, of being alone in this way, and keep on moving. It's better than living in this self built prison of fear and dread I live in anyway"
mickNcheez,23,I’ve been having a lot of trouble lately on how to stop replacing good thoughts after I have a “bad” thought! Does anyone have any tips/exposures for this kind of compulsion??

NameIntrepid,9,While dealing with such intense ocd lately I havent felt like myself at all. I feel like a completely different person and almost like I’ve gone insane. I hate it so much:(
SlipInternational593,47,"Hey guys, I would like to share something unpopular yet hopeful. I know I haven’t been the most positive person out there. In fact, I had a mental breakdown yesterday night which left me even more emotionally exhausted. I was devastated because I felt so bleak about my prognosis, especially when recovery becomes a secondary theme for me. But I think I have the responsibility to put this out there even when it might draw some flak.  Just a disclaimer, I am not trying to nail down or enforce my definition of recovery on anyone. There have been a few posts talking about how OCD recovery is only confined to management. While I won’t necessarily seek to disagree or anything, I simply wish people can be more positive in their posts and comments.   Sure, there is no “cure” for OCD, but I think the meaning of “recovery” is wayyyy more than mere management and coping with symptoms. We are meant to thrive, and sure, the recovery journey may not be smooth, but I personally believe if we invest the time and effort into recovery, it will come to a point in our lives that when we look back, we see how far we have come.  I think everyone is made differently, so I won’t wish to impose my beliefs and convictions on n anyone else. With that being said, I will like to also spend less time on Reddit and focus on living my life in the physical world. I hope everyone can adopt a positive mindset towards recovery. Nobody knows what the future holds, but I think we shouldn’t be so quick to come to a conclusion that we have to just settle for our current situation. Who knows, we might come to a point where we have a good grasp on our OCD, and that might be our definition of a “cure”, subjectively speaking.   Take care of yourselves, as do I each and every single day."
mickNcheez,23,"I suffer really badly from mental compulsions and it’s harder because sometimes they just feel so automatic ugh! I’ve been getting better at saying “maybe, maybe not” or “it’s possible” and it’s been really freeing but sometimes I feel a strong need to either counteract “wrong” thoughts with other ones but I know it’s reassurance and I don’t want that! I just want advice on how everyone who might have had this dealt with it! Hope y’all are safe and having a great day so far 💖"

SlipInternational593,47,"The worst thing about having OCD is that you think you are the untreatable one. That no one has it worse than you. That you have simply have the worst obsession beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. I have pure O with harm and false memories. That you see no way out other than taking your own life. I have been let down by clinicians, who informed me via websites that OCD can only be managed. No, if management is taking a wild roller coaster throughout life, waxing and waning so many times that it absorbs all the life out of me? Then no, I don’t want it. If management means putting up with side effects of my meds for the rest of my life? No, I don’t want it either.   My friends are a selfish bunch, who don’t see my side, and simply living their own privileged, entitled lives. I don’t want to leave my loved ones, who have invested so much in me, and I am beyond thankful that I have the love and support of them, which I know many don’t have. They are the ones closest to understanding me. But should I be more selfish, knowing that meeting my Maker would simply take all the pain away?   Not a single soul understands me, no, not a single one."

NameIntrepid,9,Does working through ocd in general provide the same results rather than focusing on each individual theme? Mine obviously stems from anxiety so I wonder if by working on that it would cancel out my ocd?
NameIntrepid,9,It’s so weird like.. I’ve had ocd almost my entire life but after the whole covid lockdown it really started to be a bigger problem for me. But now it’s just a part of me in a sense? It’s hard to explain but I can’t put a finger on how I feel anymore. It’s all kind of blurred together. I’m unable to recognize my themes and the meaning of why I’m constantly doing that? Idk if any of this makes sense but shit be frustrating af.

Sommet_,22,"My mother unfortunately got a small oil stain on her white shoes. She came inside and started to wash the shoes in the sink where I mostly wash my hands in (well we have a double sided sink and she used the right side while I use the left for washing my hands). They are fairly new shoes but I don’t know if any water splashed onto the side I wash my hands on. She also placed the shoes at the edge of the sink. I have no gloves but I plan to clean both sides of the sink with a SOS pad, lysol wipes, and lysol disinfectant spray. I don’t know if this would do the job to get as many germs off the sink from the shoes as possible. Should I worry? Am I going at this right?"

SlipInternational593,47,"I kinda feel like this form of OCD is uncommon... but this is THE defining trait of my OCD (alongside Harm OCD, since false memory rarely exists on its own). Does anyone experience this? My brain is literally stuck 11 years ago where I thought I could have taken away a life, and I don’t even dare to use the k-word or m-word, because I don’t want anybody to think I’m a horrible person or what. I just want to feel less alone. And not to undermine anyone’s suffering, but I always have this conviction that none has it as bad as me, at least with the content and the intensity of the anxiety. I can’t know for sure the magnitude of other sufferers’ anxiety, but this is how I feel concerning my own PCD experience.

I’ve had DPDR for about 7 months and I started obsessing over when or it I was feeling better.. One obsession I picked up is if I feel like my room or something around me feels normal or how it used to feel before I got dpdr. Now I don’t feel like I’m at the place I’m at. I have this weird feeling of being somewhere else. It’s a very strong and intense feeling too. I can’t get rid of it.
Sommet_,22,"I literally wasted 4 loads worth of washes because I feel they are not clean enough by putting less detergent in it or, I put too much detergent and it’ll get stuck into my clothes resulting in it not rinsing out translating to not having clean clothes. I don’t know anymore. I use HE Tide and I have an HE top loading washer."
Sommet_,22,"I’m about to wash the same load of towels 4 times already, my OCD is killing me. The first couple times i felt they needed to be washed again and i stuck them in the washer again without having them in the spin cycle so they were soaked which made me feel that I needed to wash them again after because I know that germs love it when it’s wet. Then the 3rd time washing it the washer became soapy and I searched up that that is bad not only for the washer but for your clothes as well. Now I’m about to wash them again after all this. This time i’ll use less soap and have it not sud up."
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,Me when I stare at someone’s butt and then question if I actually wanted to stare at their butt or not: you are a horrible person how could you do that   A few hours later after I reassured myself:meh I’m over it   And the cycle repeats...
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,staring ocd is just grate :)
mickNcheez,23,No reassurance just advice
Ogenz,31,"So I have been having thoughts like ""What is this?"". Thought that questions what is reality, like literally what is this and everything. Its like I have my body, and my thoughts that are disconnected from my body. Its like viewing everything from third person kinda. It feels weird and I wonder if this is maybe pure-o, or am I going crazy?"
mickNcheez,23,What do I do? Do I just risk it like I’m supposed to? Help!
NameIntrepid,9,Do any of yall ever think like wow.. I can’t picture myself without this terrible mental illness. Whenever I seem to get better I just ruin it by that mindset and it sucks ass. It’s like.. I’ve been dealing with these intense feelings and thoughts for so long it’s almost like it’s my life now.
massivesmoke,49,"OK so i was watching a movie, and the villains are so fucking bitchy   i got shit angry, i have a bad side, a one that is very sadistic and would totally inflict shitload of harm on someone and enjoy seeing them in pain. so i imagine if i was the main character, taking revenge and torturing the bitches. so, during my pedo ocd phase some thoughts came when i imagine hurting someone, like (and not to get political) my most hated person on earth, non other than the child abuser: bill clinton. in general, i would consider rape as a method of torture since it can do shitload of harm, and thoughts used to come like ""if u could travel in time and catch bill clinton when he was a child, do u feel like raping him?"" in reality i dont feel like a child can be evil, and if so i think they need proper treatment, if it doesnt work i think an easy death is needed. thats my opinion, however this was reflected onto the fantasy of me taking revenge lol, an intrusive thought came ""if they were children, will u still consider rape"" and me in the middle of a rage moment answered ""yes because they are the devil, and the devil can take many forms"" and yes please stop laughing and continue i know its cringy and cliche yet fucked up line, anyway so there i stopped, i was like tf did i just say? hurting a child is wrong dude and honestly when i imagined some stuff in a manner of checking, i realized that i dont just feel disgusted by children (something i also realized long ago in the phase of pedo ocd) mixed with sex, but i also hate to see them in pain in any fucking way, i mean im the dude who keeps talking about how i want to murder everyone who abuses children with no mercy and how i will totally enjoy it to the point where i actually think i have some form of illness that can make me snap at one point and commit a very sadistic murder as a response to someone hitting their child. is it wrong to hurt a chikd? yes. did i think of something wrong? yes. i feel like the worst person in the world, man if bill clinton was a child i wouldnt do shit to him i would probably get responsible for making him a good person instead of the monster that he is now. and i realized something i actually thought only one of the villains is hot, as an adult for sure lol, and not the other. and i didnt consider any sexual acts with a youner versions or shit. man im kinda lost about it, did i think of something bad that reflects how much of a bad person i am? will i actually hurt a child if they were evil and i had a chance? is this ocd or am i just a bad person? i feel so ashamed and guilty"
sharksandpickles,45,I did something really bad last year and a few months ago and I felt so guilty I couldn't stop thinking about it and feeling awful... but now I don't get that extreme of a feeling. I feel horrible. Am I losing empathy?
mickNcheez,23,"Yesterday my friend asked if I wanted to go shoot at a gun range, I wanted to go as I had never shot a gun before and I was nervous ab that sure but today in the morning before I left my brain kept telling me that if I went that I was gonna lose control and hurt someone or myself and so I shouldn’t go and I should stay home! I was super nervous by this point and went “NO I wanna go and have fun with my friend so I’m going!!” And I kept hearing in my head as I was getting in my car to leave to “turn back now! The worst is gonna happen ur gonna go to jail” and you know what I said to it? I said “tough!” And I went and as we walked in I was so nervous and when we got in the range I was even more nervous! But we started shooting at the targets and I had a lot of fun! I left feeling proud of myself but then it started up again being like “the fact that you even thought it means ur bad! Ur sad u didn’t do anything bad” and I had a bit of anxiety but after that it was eh 🤷‍♀️  my ocd themes constantly change and shift but in the end it really is all the same thing, ocd. Really proud of myself today! 🤗"
carter_pride,46,"Disclaimer: This is not medical advice, but just something that I experienced personally today and would like to share as a personal story and rant about.  Feel free to remove if I'm breaking rules.  ""Just Right"" OCD is so complex and convoluted.  Very often I don't know why I behave the way I do or why certain things or people trigger me.    Lately I'd been struggling with a few people and acute mental resistance towards a few things I want to do.  Something that helped me is combining imaginal/verbal ERP with cognitive restructuring.    Once I slowed down and actually noticed the inner drama through introspection - I began to understand the subliminal resistance to my goals. I used self-disputation to try to reason with my inner demons.  However, this really only gave me minor relief - it never really felt like much of a ""mental workout"" - which is a good sign of progress.  Well, today I coupled the self-disputation with a few verbal/imaginal exposures where I repetitively vocalized my ""bad thoughts"" and, honestly, I felt like I ran on a treadmill.  I felt exhausted.  It felt like a real exposure!  I realized that my magical thinking had caused me to be triggered by these people and the ""bad words"" they use - because I feared that I would morph and become these people. The irrational belief I had was that if I repeated their words or thought or behaved like them or listened to their advice - I would become them.    This was at the heart of my resistance.  This weird magical thinking or core belief.  So cognitive restructuring / downward arrow methods / self-disputation  was not enough; in fact, it was only when I created a bizarre exposure - I said out loud that I was going to become these people by repeating their ""bad words"" - that I felt challenged and then finally some sort of relief.  ""Just Right"" OCD is incredibly complex.  It's ever changing and the complexity of these weird hairballs that it creates in the human mind - it's all truly insidious.  We need more research and combination therapy for this utter madness.  I really wonder how much of humanity is trapped inside their own ridiculous rules and fears and magical fears.  I mean, look at the pervasiveness of scrupulosity in society today - I sometimes think that we're f-ed as a species.  So much of therapy is ""closed source"" instead of ""open source"" - it's not taught in basic schools, and it requires expensive therapists.  If it's so much hard work and introspection, if it's so hard to access therapy, if it's hard to learn and practice this stuff - how can we possibly be expected to win against our inner demons?  How will humanity ever cast off its chains if we don't democratize and open-source mental healthcare? It makes no sense.  I sometimes think that we are all literally prisoners on this goddamn rock and slaves inside our heads."
Right_now78,41,"there is a lot of similarities between both... i got rid of the religion ""ocd"" by educating myself about how they are human made but idk what to do to ocd lol"
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,"So something happens that I feel guilty about, then I get over it, then another thing happens that I feeel guilty about, then I get over it and the cycle continues"
sharksandpickles,45,"I'm a bit confused with my thoughts and feelings. If I see an anime character say that they enjoy killing people, my brain is just ""ohh damn ok"" even though I know murder is wrong?? It makes me feel like I don't care. But when they DO kill people I'm like what the fuck and feel bad. And like lately I've been thinking whether or not I'm a good person. I've done bad things. I have evil thoughts (can't tell whether they're intrusive or not but they make me feel so guilty and bad). Yesterday, when I saw an anime character say they enjoy killing people, I got thoughts like ""why does it matter"" and I'm like what the fuck?? It does matter, it's awful. But then my brain asks, ""why is it awful? It's not that big of a deal"" or something like that and I start thinking if *I* feel that way. It makes me feel awful. I got the same thoughts when I heard how someone brutally killed someone and I feel bad because of it. And then I start questioning whether or not crimes are always wrong or if I feel that way and things like that. I can't imagine myself killing someone but I feel like since my thoughts are like this, I may be a horrible person."
mickNcheez,23,How do I fix this? Is it just back door spike?
pleaseimconfused,21,"tw// grooming, pocd, execution of pedophiles   hello. so i was diagnosed with OCD when i was around 13, i am now 17 and female.   when i was younger (14) i was groomed by two different men in similar time frames and since then i started fearing sex while simultaneously having hypersexual periods.    recently i have developed POCD, my brain will over analyze every interaction i have with children to try to make sure i’m not attracted to them, thoughts telling me that i might have harmed a child or even sudden outbursts of graphic imagery.. i’ll literally feel bile rising to my throat it disgusts me and i just wish i could get rid of this. i wake up every day and spend hours ruminating and seeking reassurance and doing my compulsions.   i hate it and the thought of hurting a child is extremely nauseating to me, and i’ve always had normal attractions to people my age or older. my brain even creates false memories which i obsess over and feel guilty over, so i know that it’s ocd due to the fact it distresses me so much.    sometimes i just want to end it all, i’m sick of my own head never letting me live in peace. every second feels like it contains a disaster waiting to happen   however during my reassurance / symptom searching about p*dophilia found a news article on the guardian about the pedophiles who check themselves into therapy and get help because they don’t want to hurt a child by any means and learn to control themselves.   at first i worried that this might be me, but then i assessed my attraction and realized it’s intrusive thoughts.   however, i started feeling bad for these ppl who have to live with this as they genuinely want treatment for since it’s like a mental illness almost. i guess i’ve always been a naive person who hoped that people can change for the better...   i think the attraction itself is disgusting but wanting to seek help and not be a child abuser is better for society, and obviously pedophilia is disgusting, but is it bad to feel bad / pitiful for those who want to seek help because they know they have something wrong with them? i feel like the fact that i think those who do want help should go to therapy and the ones who offend should be jailed means i’m sympathizing with the actions themselves and it worries me because now i don’t want to be someone who wants to promote bad behavior.   i have some internet friends who said all of them should be executed or kill themselves.  then i told them that what about the people who don’t want to hurt others and get help, i feel bad for the fact resources are limited and i think the people who have a will to never hurt another should be able to get resources even if it means castrations. however now i feel so disgusted with myself, like why didn’t i just agree along and say every one should be murdered.  the whole thing is a pitiful situation,  both the fact children are abused and have to suffer so much, and the fact there are people out there who genuinely do not want to hurt a child but their brain is messed up.  anyways i’m here bc o want to know if thinking that those pedos who are “”’non offending”” and wanting to get help shouldn’t be executed but instead given resources to control themselves and never hurt a child is wrong? i’m scared that makes me a pedophile or a sympathizer, although i was groomed myself and i think the actions are disgusting and that the attraction is wrong. my brain keeps telling me the fact i think they should get therapy means i’m secretly a pedo and a horrible person"
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,I just wanted to hear if people had this problem?
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,I’m thinking that I may have ocd way back like a year ago and didn’t realise it was ocd. For example one time I took a test and saw something on the wall that reminded me of the answer but then I got nervous cause I thought that I cheated.
mickNcheez,23,"It’s just that sometimes ocd changes up intrusive thoughts and makes me feel like I will act on them one day and it makes me spiral 😭 just not sure what to do about this or what kind of erp to use against it, do I do the same thing I’ve always been doing and just be like “ok sure whatever”?"
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,It would be nice to chat to someone with ocd cause I haven’t been diagnosed yet
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,Here’s the link if you want to check it out https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/mvhmva/ocd_blog/
Right_now78,41,"i am a male i started taking sertraline 2 weeks ago for OCD and not for depression but now i do have it because of this problem , 100 mg  is my daily dose, my problem is i always need to pee but either nothing comes or just a little , and i feel like my bladder is full, this got worse that i thought i have cancer or something ( ocd u know) but i don't and this constant need to pee is so FRUSTRATING it depressing,  can i stop it just after 2 weeks or wait it out ? im fearing if i stop it now there would worse side effects ugh i am so messed up and confused."
carter_pride,46,I’m tired of disentangling all these chains.  How much of me is OCD and how much of me is the real me?  Will I ever feel free again?  God stole too much from me.  God was an abuser and he stole from me and he raped me.  I not holding my breath for some sort of justice anymore.  I just want to feel free again.
Sommet_,22,Do you guys ever feel uncomfortable when walking next to a trashcan on the street or walk by a garbage truck driving next to you?
mickNcheez,23,I’m trying to get through this but it’s really rough what do I do?
sharksandpickles,45,"Just a while ago, I was like,, pretty empathetic and I used to get upset and sad when I used to see videos or news about people getting hurt, but now I feel like I don't really feel a thing or react at all, except like an ""oh"" or ""that's really bad wtf"". I feel horrible for that. I feel like an awful person. I want to have empathy, but when I see something bad happening online... my brain just kinda doesn't seem to care, or at least react. Is this normal or am I going crazy?? All I want is to be a good person. I keep checking my emotions and reactions to things but when I don't react, I start freaking out."
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,"I’m starting a blog to document each day and just have a space ik I can always come back to. Maybe this can help other people as well , I’m assuming I can start a blog on here,"
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,Just to vent about each day
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,Anyone else? Like I’ll turn around and then I’ll see someone’s butt and stare and turn away
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,I purposely thought of a bad thought any advice?
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,So I was on the toilet(I like to sit down while on the toilet even though im male) and then i thought about pulling up my penis so everyone  can see9theurs a big window next to my toilet btw but its blurry when you look through it and i think i may have acted on it
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,"so I went on r/advice subreddit and one the replies said this  &#x200B;     OP-  ""Today has just felt different from most days and also at one point I think I purposely imagined a child naked but then after felt really guilty about it and also got scared that I was only guilty about my pocd because I might be convicted and cause of social stigma and not cause I actually am against it""  You're teetering on the pedophile line, get some professional help before you hurt someone."
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,So I looked down and looked at the part of my friends skirt that was open you know the front part but I did it purposefully
NameIntrepid,9,Is this normal at all?? I’ll start to believe my obsessive thoughts sometimes and they’ll become part of my reality. It’s like I become what my unwanted thoughts are saying. Not literally but yea.. and it sucks so much.. for example I’ll believe something about my mind that isn’t true but my mind start showing signs of that. Idk if any of this makes sense lol.
rioboy1985,37,"One of the most important things I've learned (and often don't remember) about OCD is that the content /theme is irrelevant. It's a misfiring signal from your brain that is sending the thoughts and your reaction to this is the problem.  You might have contamination OCD and get the thought that you've got germs on your hands, even after washing them 20 times. Another person might have scrupulosity and say the same prayer 50 times to try and get it right. It doesn't matter what the theme is, it's all a misfiring of the brain, and our erroneous reactions to these misfirings that is the real problem.  I often catch myself spending maybe hours trying to solve a problem, which when ""resolved"" just generates another. If, every time, I remembered that the content is irrelevant, and just lived with the uncertainty, fear, etc, this would eventually show my brain that bad things aren't gonna happen and I can just continue with my day  OCD is like dominoes. You  knock down one (compulsion) and end up setting off a chain reaction. This can lead to an obsessive loop and feelings of emptiness, depression etc.  I want to focus on just letting the thoughts be there, whatever the content, because the content doesn't matter. This way I hope to fix my broken brain"
NameIntrepid,9,I feel like I’m tangled between all of my random obsessive thoughts. I feel foreign to my own mind and myself. I feel weird and very awkward. I can’t get a grip because I’m so lost inside my thoughts. I hate it so much.
rioboy1985,37,"So I'm from the UK but I live in Brazil. I was dating a girl for years here in Rio de Janeiro, we split up then got back together many times. One of the main reasons for breaking up was my constant reassurance seeking in terms of asking questions (Did I hit you? Did I commit a crime against you? Etc). I would accidently bump into her on the street as we walked and become convinced I had hit her. When she said that I hadn't hit her I would understand it as that I ""had hit her"" and I would repeat the same question over and over. Now, in my heart of hearts I knew that I hadn't hit her, and I knew what her first answer was. But it's so hard when your mind and your anxiety try to convince you otherwise.  Anyway, we broke up last year again as I reverted back to my old OCD reassurance seeking and she was losing all attraction to me. Recently, I found out she was with another guy and this has broken me. Since then my OCD has went nuts and I've been having a hard time. I've realised that emotional upheaval can be a massive trigger for OCD.  She is the love of my life. I just wish I could get this monster of OCD under control to be 100% in the moment, and capable of having a normal, healthy relationship.  Anybody else have similar experiences? It's good to know that I'm not alone and that's why this subreddit is awesome"
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,So basically I tput my leg out and thought I was gonna rape someone when I wasnt even close enough to anyone in the room and then I didnt do anything right away I think I even smiled
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,I feel like im just blaming all my problems on ocd and that I just post here so I dont have to post on places like r/advice
mickNcheez,23,To do exposures for this do I treat it like any other intrusive thought? I feel like ocd will always give u doubt and make it seem like your the exception to this rule but I think it just wants certainty of that right?
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,"So it was snowing and I was on my trampoline and my bro was on it with me and we kept falling over and I touched his butt, I think I purposefully did it as well"
littledaisy_07,8,"Have some of you experienced improvement since you were diagnosed? And if so, how long did it take? I feel like I need to climb the highest mountain I’ve ever seen and I’d love to read some positivity (I know you’re never perfectly cured but still)"
mickNcheez,23,I’m just afraid that I’ll lose my values or that agreeing like we are supposed to do with ocd will go wrong! I guess I’m just supposed to take the risk right?
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,I did something terrible when i WAS AROUND 11-12 AND IN LATE 2020 (it happened in 2018) I began to feel really guilty and scared because I needed to confess but was scared of how people would view me and if I would go to prison or not. I told my school and nothing much happened from their but now im thinking of new memories of the ncident and a few days ago I was thinking of if I told my school everything about the incident. For example what age I was like I told them it was 11-12 but im not sure if I told them the right age
RockyK96,36,"I’ve seen a lot of conflicting thoughts on this, is it something that can’t be officially or scientifically proven or not proven?"
mickNcheez,23,I know that I’m supposed to just agree and move on but it’s rough because I’m scared I’ll actually agree with them or do the exposure wrong or something and it keeps me in a constant loop of anxiety! What do I do??
rioboy1985,37,"Does anyone ever wonder what life is like without OCD? Like, how does a normal mind feel? Is the person mostly or always in peace? What's it like not to make the most random connections even in your sleep and lose the whole night worrying about them? I wonder if I seem so weird to people who don't have OCD even when I try to hide it? What's it like to have a relationship that isn't destroyed by OCD? I wonder...  I feel so alone. I really want to make my life something great, the best it can be, but OCD is always there, attacking my dreams and whatever is precious to me. I'm learning to overcome, but I do wonder what would it be like if I never had OCD"
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,So in yr9 I slapped someone and also someone accidentally hit me in the nuts so I tried several times to do that as well and succeeded
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,So in yr9 I put my hand on this guys neck and I just remembered it now and I’m feeling guilty about it!!!!
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,I feel guilty about something then I feel the guilt gone and then another thing happens and I feel guilty about that too
littledaisy_07,8,"Hello there! I’ll make it as short as I can. I was diagnosed with OCD one month ago after spending so long wondering what was wrong with me. I’ve been seeing a therapist (who really helps me!) since then and I feel like, without these appointments, I’d really really struggle much more than I do now. However here is the thing: I make my compulsions and rituals as discreet as I can when my mother is around. I'm afraid she could think I’m completely crazy and I’m ashamed of being like that and of wasting around 4 hours a day because of OCD. The problem is: she thinks I’m making it up. She thinks my therapy is useless and I’m weak because I can’t get better on my own. She also complains about it being a waste of money.  As many of you know, most of your days are a real pain in the ass because of the amount of time you spend having awful/terrifying intrusive thoughts and feeling the need to perform so many rituals. I sometimes truly feel like I’m falling in an endless hole because of the anxiety it brings... What would you suggest to make my mother realise I’m in pain and just want to be helped? I truly want to make the situation less heavy and have a """"normal"""" life again...Thank you!"

sharksandpickles,45,I'm 14. My family is pretty aggressive and my parents usually discipline us kids by hitting us and doing other violent things.... but that doesn't excuse what I did. Last year I hurt my brother physically out of anger (hit him on the back multiple times) and it left him a mark for a little while. I feel so fucking disgusted with myself and I wish I never did that. My brother deserves better. He was only six. I was thirteen. I should've known better. I did try to change myself and control my anger but I still can never forgive myself. My brother himself said it didn't hurt but I don't know if I believe him. He's a kid. I feel awful. --- I have intrusive thoughts about harming others but my siblings and I have hit each other multiple times which I regret. It's sadly pretty normalized in our family. Is it possible to have harm ocd with a past of violence acts? Or am I just a horrible person
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,so my penis brushed past a sheet or a cover and im thinking that its the equivalent to rape and now I feel guilty(idek if this makes sense)
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,I havent been diagnosed yet but it started when I was watching a video on toddlers and tiaras and I stared at one pf the toddlers legs where her skirt ends and then I was like why did stare there?

Infinite_Tax_6567,3,so you know those gmail dating site bots that show up on the chat? Well I got a few of those and one time I looked at the chat and it was just a women I think lying down and showing her boobs and so I got attracted and thought of m'sterbating to it but then I looked again and didnt really think of the women as attractive so I didnt.

So then I do pomodoro so that I do work on the pomodoro work time and I'm allowed, but I don't have to OCD on the pause. Eventually I've noticed that **this leads me to feel less willing to OCD on the pause**, since after work I also feel like actually having a pause, rather than doing something OCD-related.  **Having the pomodoro in place prevents you from overworking, which should cause increase in symptoms. Which you don't want, you want to decrease symptoms and increase work-ability.**  As an idea, pomodoro may be utilized to ""build up"" work-ability. Start with small work periods, work them up."
mavavilj,40,"Anyone else think it could work if OCD forum wasn't about OCD, but about OCD recovery?  Lately I've noticed that I visit this site and it fuels my OCD by reminding that I have/have had it. Rather than trying to forget OCD entirely.  I.e. I appear to develop a cycle for checking reddit.com/r/OCD in order to analyze my symptoms.  If this was [reddit.com/r/OCDRecovery](https://reddit.com/r/OCDRecovery) then it would perhaps fuel the idea that ""you need to get out of this"", rather than ""be reminded of it and dwell on it"".  It has even been said here a few times. **There are perhaps too many posts that are in essence reassurance seeking**, which is not beneficial.  The book that I have mentions several times that while it's common to ""dwell on symptoms"", the real progress lies in *making progress*, rather than going through describing symptoms over and over again.  \---  Lets see if we can produce a better forum for pro-recovery:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCDRecovery/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCDRecovery/)"
RockyK96,36,"I think that the times where my brain made me so anxious and upset in convincing me in a false reality that it may have genuinely traumatized me. I couldn’t eat at all, had to take sleep aids to sleep, spent every minute tormented and terrified. Lexapro helped dig me out of that hole but i’m terrified of ever getting back to that point, I was a mess and couldn’t function. Maybe trauma isn’t necessarily the right word but I don’t know how else to describe the kind of mental pain I was in at times like that and how it affects me now."
Altruistic_System_41,18,In think I’ve lost to hocd  Today I was listening to music and making a song and I had the same gay thoughts and I gave into to them because my Brian was saying do what makes you happy and it’s like I enjoyed it but no I’m kinda anxious I still don’t like gay porn or stuff like that so I don’t know anymore than I looked at a women and didn’t feel any interest I’m scared I’m gonna go to sleep have a dream and enjoy the thoughts usually I wake up and say I’m not gay but now i don’t after dreams anymore I dont what to do i stopped having false memories I remember liking women now but imma mess
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,Ik it sounds bad but I wish my themes were different. I sometimes think that if my themes were centred around germs than I wouldn’t think of myself as such an evil person. Then again ik in reality that isn’t the case
mavavilj,40,"I discovered ""eraser meditation"" as feeling very effective for intrusive thoughts. Anyone else?  I actually didn't know before hand that it's a before known meditation style. Rather, I just invented it from scratch, when I lied on my bed today and was thinking about ""what would the **inverse** of all intrusive thoughts be"". And then I figured to attempt to play a mental game, where I erase the thoughts and feeling in my head. Analogously to erasing words written with a pencil, until the word and sentences are not visible anymore.  I don't know about others, but for me this seems very effective. I can very quickly notice that the strain on head loosens and I can feel a boost in serotonin flow. Doing it like ""playing a game"" seems to keep it interesting as well.  Anyone else find this useful?"
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,so when im drinking from a bottle of coke or something I think that some of my saliva has ended up int the bottle and in the drink so I drink more to get the saliva but ofc that just makes it worse

sharksandpickles,45,"I was talking to the psychologist about my thoughts and I told him about this one thought that I couldn't tell if it was real or not. He then said something that made me doubt myself. He said that they're just thoughts but then he said that I may be/have ""a little..."" (I really don't remember what he said, I probably made this whole thing up idk) but then he asked me if I would ever be able to shoot someone. I got surprised by the sudden question, but he asked something else before I got to answer. I'm so confused. Why would he say those things? Does he think I'm a creep? Should I tell about this to him the next time I get to talk to him? This is freaking me out."

I've talked to someone from ocd uk about it and they said that I quote    ""The problem is that for you reporting it could be detrimental to your wellbeing because it could lead to you noticing more things that might be sexual harassment and lead you to report everything where there is any doubt. This is how OCD can get worse.  If you feel unsure about this then talking to someone at school might help, particularly if they know about OCD and how confessing can be a compulsion. I hope this is a little clearer to you,""  so what should I do?"
Elusive-Yoda,25,"I read on internet that untreared ocd can become more difficult to get rid of, but they only talk about the complulsive ocd.  what about intrusive thoughts? There isn't much else i can do other then ignore them and go on with my business 🤷‍♂️"

Sometimes if I’m sitting close to people or just walking I’ll just start thinking I’m gonna rape someone which I don’t wanna do but then if I make a sudden movement then I start thinking I wanted to rape the person sitting next to me.

pleaseimconfused,21,"tw suicide, violent intrusive thoughts, pocd mention, self harm, abuse mention, mental hospital   hello. i was diagnosed with ocd, adhd and depression + anxiety and was in an emotionally and physically abusive childhood... when i was 9 i started to self harm and was very suicidal, and i had ocd behaviors such as contamination and religious fears since that age. i had seeking therapy. i am 17F  however, when i was 11 and got into middle school i mixed with a certain crowd of people who were also mentally ill and they introduced me to tumblr. i went to a psychiatric hospital 3 times in middle school because of suicide, and 5 times total in my life. i recently came out two months because of attempting suicide yet i still want to die, every day i feel that i don’t deserve any of the help and that i’m an evil person   so here’s one of my mistakes: when i was 11 i found out about DID and i thought i really did have it because i related to some of the symptoms and then for less than a week i pretended i had it. i never used it to hurt a person or as an excuse for bad behaviors, actually this was 7 years ago and i genuinely am so fucking embarrassed, i don’t know what the hell was wrong with me. i only really talked about it online once and i rediscovered it a year ago and deleted it because it was so embarrassing and odd, i feel so guilty.  however, now i feel so afraid that i’m making everything else up because of my stupidity and ignorance back then. i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety before that even happened, and then i was evaluated for ocd and diagnosed multiple without me even suspecting i had it. but my brain keeps telling me that ‘what if you’re lying, and maybe you really are all the bad things you fear you are and that you’re not even really mentally ill” and i get urges to quit all my meds and never go to therapy again or just kill myself.  and i wonder if i’m making everything up and that nothing is real at all and that all my issues don’t exist.   even though i’m tormented by intrusive thoughts about wanting to hurt others or contamination or people i love getting hurt somehow.  i have these bad urges and thoughts saying that i should slice my face off. however, i feel like i don’t deserve any help, what if i’m just making this up?? even though i get extreme nagging thoughts and i can’t shake them off until i do certain things, like confessing or constantly apologizing or washing my hands, i once washed my hands in extremely hot water when i had already dry skin with eczema cuts just to shake off the gnawing feeling that i might be a pedophile.    i’ve tried to kill myself three times and i genuinely think that the only solution to making up for my past mistakes would be dying, and i don’t even think i deserve to have resources. i cry and pray that a god exists so he can kill me and beg him to let me die because i don’t deserve being alive, i genuinely want to be dead.  once i was in the bathroom holding an eyebrow razor and i kept hearing this voice telling me i should swipe my face or else i’m a pedophile and that i should be punished for my other mistakes.  i was dragging it across my face but then i caught myself about to swipe hard and was extremely startled.  sorry for the long post, but thank you so much if you read any of this, and typing emotions out is kind of awkward for me, so i’m sorry if some of my sentences sound strange."

mavavilj,40,Every moment you spend on obsessions or compulsions could be spent on a recovering activity.  So i.e. instead of obsessing/doing a compulsion:  * take a short walk * take in sunlight / artificial light * meditate * take a nap * yoga * drink tea * ...
mavavilj,40,"It seems that merely stacking on serotonin is not all there is? But more about ""balance""?  I tend to find that increasing serotonin does relieve symptoms, but since there are plenty of other things going on in foods etc. than serotonin, then I've found that doing different kinds of portions produces a different sort of anxiety control. Too much of something and anxiety relief might turn into a sort of ""hyperbluntness"" (you start to get warm feelings and kind of nauseating feel good, rather than normal impulse control)."
mickNcheez,23,No reassurance please I just want advice

I keep more than a million in cash in my brokerage account.  There was a time in my life when I had to skip meals or go to people’s home for meals.  There was a time when I had no money for a car, and then I remember I would run out of cash for gas for the clunker I bought after scrubbing toilets all Christmas.  Unfortunately I am now also surrounded by gold diggers and broke family.  The very people who used to abuse me now want constant handouts and blackmail me constantly.  I don’t feel safe without a lot of money hoarded.  I want to invest and trade, but I can’t spend it.  I remember there was a time when I would not look at envelopes because I was phobic of overdue bills.  I still can’t open my mail, and let it clutter my house.  It’s been years this way.

I feel completely disgusted with myself and I'm afraid I may act out on these thoughts even though I don't want to. I can't imagine myself harming other people and feeling arousal over it. It makes me sick.
mavavilj,40,"My list:  * Corrective inner speech can be essential. It's about recognizing and ""disassuring"" that the thoughts you obsess now are unnecessary, unreasonable so on. It doesn't mean that they cannot be accurate or meaningful, just that you want to let go of them at the moment. And you do the correction right when obsessioning starts. Correction is therefore not ""cheating"", it's about efficiency. It may feel like cheating, if you're fixated to ""just right"" OCD / similar. But it's not, it's about learning to effectively process negative thoughts. * Obsessioning does not necessarily add to quality of observation, try whether you can produce same outcomes without obsessing. You may be surprised to discover that obsessioning just makes it more difficult. * Obsessioning may make things much harder. * Obsessioning may not be helpful. * Obsessioning that's unreasonable is unrealistic, unnecessary, ... * Obsessioning may take time from other activities. * Everytime you start to obsess, why not rather replace it with some other way of managing stress? Such as, taking a walk, doing some yoga or something. Note: based on my experience, doing this actually may seem like hassle, since you may be very fixated to OCDing for anxiety relief. But it's objectively better and **more normal** than doing OCD. And doing it instead of OCD should become easier over time. * The idea of ""controlling"" or ""pure"" thoughts is mostly delusional. Normal reasoning does not require the kind of control or ""purity"" that OCD gives you. The very habit of requiring purity or control or certainty or ... is an OCD symptom."

sharksandpickles,45,"I need reassurance.. Okay so a few weeks ago I started getting a weird feeling down there when someone talked about scary or violent stuff and I thought I was slowly turning into a psychopath. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I felt so disgusted with myself. One day I was sitting next to my sister while she was watching TV. I felt worried about my groinal responses so I decided to go to the bathroom and lock the door because I had no idea how to explain my problem to my sister without sounding crazy. Instantly, after I locked the door, I started crying like crazy. My heartbeat had probably never been that fast and I felt like I was gonna throw up. My face felt so puffy and it looked so red. I thought I had finished crying, so I went to sit next to my sister. I couldn't keep it inside me anymore so I asked her if I could talk about something and she said yes. I told her about the weird arousal feelings I've gotten down there and again, I started crying because I don't wanna be a psychopath. My sister got super mad because she had told me it's just my thoughts messing with me but when I asked about the groinal responses,  she didn't really have an answer to it. Of course my parents had to come back home right at that time and they saw me crying. I had no idea how to explain them how I get arousal feelings from violent words when I hear them or read them even though I hate them, but I somehow managed to word it and my mom said it's just my hormones because I'm a teenager. I was shaking the entire time, I was still slightly shaking after a day or two. I need reassurance that I'm not a sadistic psychopath. I don't want to hurt anyone. I really don't. If I'm being honest, before I did research about groinal responses, I was thinking of how I shouldn't live if I feel arousal by those kinds of stuff. I need help or reassurance from someone so please help. Thank you. Sorry if I overshared."
massivesmoke,49,"so i was just around a child, they were playing and they almost fell so i grabbed them from their shoulder, while doing that my hand touched their chest and BOOM ""did i enjoy this? do i like it?"" so i decided to show that everything is ok and im fine (to myself) and then intentionally held them from their shoulders  (so the scenario repeats, my hand touching their chest) and nothing happened, i decided to ignore my ocd and focus on what i actually felt. the intention was not evil, the child was not touched sexually or for the purpose of having sexual pleasure, it is a very normal way to hold a child and i did this shit load of times before , i mean u know how it is if u grab a child from their shoulders and they are small, or for example when they get stubborn and start kicking so u have to grab them from their legs, thighs, arms, belly or whatever u can get so they dont fall on the ground! but my ocd now is going like ""u just molested a child"" ""u touched a child sexually""   tbh im over my pocd to some level, it developed into something else, but i still have casual thoughts related to it and what happened today maybe shows that i still have pedophilia ocd and it just changed the way it comes to me. i feel shit, i just held a child literally in the most normal way and now i feel like i abused them sexually, i always held children like this and in some moments of anger they kicked while i was holding them, almost fell, and then i had to grab them from their thigh while holding them from their arms at the same time AND IT WASNT EVER AROUSING OR ANYTHING LIKE WTF   in case someone didnt get what happened, i hold a child in a way that would make my hand touch their chest witout even thinking about it, like i didnt want to have a physical contact with them like that. then my ocd tells me i enjoyed it, so i decided to shut my ocd up and hold the child the same way which is in no way sexual. u know how u hold a dog? a small dog, u probably want to hold them but whether u want it or not u will be touching their arms while doing that. yes its the exact same thing here, i hold a child knowing (yet trying to avoid) that my hand may be touching their chest when i hold them, it was not sexual or intented to be sexual, just a normal thing. and my ocd is like ""bro u just abused a child"""
RockyK96,36,"Like, I am someone who likes to know I am doing well and be told i’m loved and appreciated and I think thats healthy and normal.

I can tell with more intense OCD situations but sometimes I question my own reality and if i’m asking for reassurance as a person who wants to be recognized or as a compulsion feeding into my disorder"

carter_pride,46,"For a while, I was plagued with the guilt that I had done other people wrong, and that I was actually a psychopath.

I still feel a lot of guilt.  Especially when I see random homeless people and war refugees and other random people or animals suffering.  I don't like seeing suffering."
mavavilj,40,"Everytime I get nearer to normal mental health, I understand how irrational, but""invisible"" OCD is.  It makes you spend most of your time pondering or doing things that seem extremely meaningful, but once I gain normal health I:  1. don't have the urge to do those things, especially not repeat them 2. understand how much I overreact, overcomplicate, overthink, overworry, ... under OCD 3. understand how much time I lose to actions that are **objectively quite pointless** and which in reality make me (and others) miserable  It's an addiction, which objectively does not serve much of useful purpose and destroys things that you truly look for. While it makes it seem like ""it's not that bad"" or ""this is very important"".  Truly, it makes obsessioning seem very significant. But when OCD is lifted, they don't exist.  I speculate, you cannot understand what's meant, until OCD is lifted.  OCD is not rational. It screws your perceptions.  Do not believe what it feeds you, they're not accurate concerns."
Sommet_,22,"As I was using the restroom i clogged the toilet, i asked my dad to get the plunger out of the other bathroom and he gave it to me almost chest height like 4 feet off the ground. When I handle the plunger, I usually keep it low to the ground because I’m wooried the dirty aresol or particles will float in air. I unclogged the toilet and took my shower but when i got out of the bathroom, i felt as if the particles or whatever from the plunger were still in the air, and i walked through it. Should I worry? I just got done cleaning my room and laundry and I don’t want this to completely ruin it. I’ve lately tried to ignore certain stuff and I’m doing really well. But this one really trigger me"

NameIntrepid,9,"Idk if anyone experiences this but. Over the past few weeks my intrusive thoughts have gotten so bad. It’s about my lack of trust in people due to trauma over the years because of my parents. I always feel like I’m being to much, or to annoying, or someone doesnt like me. The thoughts got so intense that it created a weird ‘vibe’ like a feeling in my head. Its unsettling and very creepy. The anxiety from it gives me this pressure in my head 24/7 and it sucks.."

Infinite_Tax_6567,3,But like you feel that you might’ve raped someone before or sexually been inappropriate towards them but you aren’t sure if you actually did that or if you were just paranoid I’m talking about events that actually happened like immediately after or during the event
Infinite_Tax_6567,3,"So it started a couple of months ago, I was watching a video about how horrible toddlers and tiaras is(the show) and then I watched and then I stared at one of the toddlers where the skirt ends and it shows her legs. I then tried to convince myself that I wasn’t a pedophile and I tried reconstructing the event to. I then began to notice more things in people like private parts boobs etc and I think that has died down but I feel it has gotten worse, now I have a fear of raping people or sexually assaulting them and I keep backing away from people and members of my family etc and doing stuff like re-checking places I was just in to see if I did anything like sexually assualt someone even if there was no one else in the area but me. I also do things like repeat to myself. “You won’t rape anyone “before entering a room for example one time as I’m allowed, I went into school to do all my work their and then I walked into the library and saw this girl. I had been struggling with the getting too close to people and trying to get away from them thing as their were other students there and now I can’t help but think I did something to her even though I’m not sure. I have other examples of this but for I’ll put them down in the comments. Anyways now it has gotten really bad, I now can’t really do much without thinking I’ll rape someone and I back away from family members and because of my fears I walk weirdly so I have back pain and idk what’s wrong with me"

OllieCad,17,"This was my first job and I lost it. I didn't get a phone call or an email just I looked at my profile today and it said terminated. I fucked up honestly, I really did.   The reason why I lost it was because I called out since my grandfather and aunt both ended up in the hospital and I honestly just like broke. Tbh I dont remember much of last week, like at all. I just went into auto pilot and just couldn't leave my house. I feel like a failure but then again I know I shouldn't be too hard myself for thinking I could handle everything when I couldn't.   I dont know what to say to my mom though, christ she's gonna be furious. Im 22 and now jobless. I'm a fucking bum now and just I feel like a fucking failure. To those here who lost their jobs what did you do? Is it okay to feel like I failed?"
OllieCad,17,"Like I dont know what has happened maybe it's my medication but I cant cry really anymore. Like I want to but it's like Im forcing myself to stop or something, whenever I get hurt or dealing with emotional stress I usually just rage and then go numb. I go numb for either a week or several months.   I went numb like throughout this whole week and just felt tired. I wanted to cry and I wanted to let my emotions out in a healthy way but like if I do I guess it feels like im just acting soft. Too soft if that makes sense. I didn't go to work at all, I stayed in bed and slept, made myself get up to feed my pets and eat, and then went right back into my room.  I just couldn't leave my house. After dealing with so much bullshit back in October then add to the fact that my grandfather and aunt both were in the hospital and no one told me or my mother until like last Saturday and then it's like why the fuck do I even care when my aunt has done some not so great fucking things to me as a child......theres the anger again.   Like I should be allowed to fucking cry. To take a break. So why the fuck cant I cry? This is just bullshit."
OllieCad,17,"Like I came in today early from work because I wasnt feeling well, walk through the door and here comes all of these questions or asking if my new scheduled is too much and they ask these questions in such an aggressive fucking way. Like I just came in the house and im not feeling good can you not please?   Like I dont understand what to do here. If I dont clean I get called lazy and every curse word under the sun, if I come early I get told to suck it up, if come home late and tired I get asked if this is much, Its like.......WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO!?!? I dont have time to clean really because of work, I came home today because I've been dealing with some stomach bug that's been fucking with me since yesterday (I throw up and stayed to finish my shift yesterday), I got promoted then asked can I handle it and when I show signs of being tired its like ""Oh suck it up"" or ""I told you so"" it's like wtf!?!?   I dont understand at all what to do. I'm trying to handle this because if I dont here comes all the fucking ""Oh but this person works two jobs and goes to school"" like good for fucking them but that's not me. Then they wondered why I dont talk about things like this. Why I dont talk about hours at work being changed or not feeling well or changes in medication or whatever. It's just if I keep everything to myself It keeps the peace and I dont have to deal with this shit.  What the hell do I do? Do I address it with my parent or just save enough to move out and never speak to them again because for fuck sakes Im done with this. I mean I tried to address saying it feels like im being interrogated but no I need to grow up and change my attitude even though you're the one with the aggressive sounding voice and spitting food out of your mouth while yelling.  Just please any advice."
PeteyZee1998,24,"I’m  23, 5’9 and about 300 pounds, most people say I look strong because of my weight, but I’m not.   I’ve never hit a fly let alone a person, in school I lost 2 fights badly.   My ultimate fear is acquiring a concussion or dying, those are my fears.   When I see other men stare me down or act erratic, I start to feel severe anxiety, and a sense of impending doom. all this is entrenched from trauma my father caused me as a child.   I witnessed him hurt my mom and me, and so I’ve grown up to immediately get a flight response not a fight response.   A man near my house asked me for a smoke and was drunk af yesterday, I gave him one, he said thanks and after that he said I’ll be coming back for you in 30 minutes. When he said that I shit myself. I see this dude around a lot but this time he was drunk. Yesterday consisted of me checking for him and locking all the doors as usual and me tearing up thinking I’m gonna die or etc.    This is not how “men act” is what men will say mostly to this , I hate toxic masculinity. I’m weak and fragile and scared. I hate danger and fighting.  I just wanna crawl into a ball and cry. People will call me the P word and I need to acknowledge I am that 😢 I’m also autistic on the low functioning side"
carter_pride,46,"But I have become a lot more used to them now, and I don’t freak out when they come back into my brain.  I also don’t fight them or try to push them out anymore.  It’s going to be fine.  It’ll be okay."
PeteyZee1998,24,"I appreciate Halloween decorations and the amount of effort that people put into it, the images of bats, as well as the candy, and etc, do not scare me, nor does Michael jacksons thriller.  What scares me or makes me feel like i am experiencing a flashback is if i watch a scary scary movie, most halloween movies people watch on halloween night, it can be triggering, it's just triggering thinking about killing or killers. That's the unfortunate part of Halloween.  There's a difference between a kids novel, or a scary little story to listen to, vs an actual movie rated R18 for people over 18, and seeing blood, chasing, murder, rage, alll things that can show up in our dreams and cause nightmares.  examples are texas cs massacre, Haloween the movie, hellraiser, and many more that involve general blood and gore.  &#x200B;  Instead a thriller is something more bearable but even that tests the waters for me.  &#x200B;  the invitation, the strangers, hush, it comes at night, don't breathe, Orphan, are all my type of movies. "
OllieCad,17,"Thats what this is like or at least for me. My trauma isnt just from one person and isnt just one thing, its multiple things from my childhood and teen years that then just collided and morphed into a monster that decided to fucking reappear after 7 years. Now after dealing with a abusive ex it feels like the monster grew a bit. I still feel him. Feel the shit he use to say that makes me second guess things. I've noticed how I've changed honestly after he came back.   I'm more distant, I've been talking and flirting with others in order to just feel something, I like this one guy who is a new possible partner but I'm keeping a distance, I havent really talked to friends or family, I barely get sleep, and I've just been so stuck in my head that I dissociate more times then I can fucking count. Honestly my antidepressants have been helping but I definitely need to be put on something else with the antidepressants. Something for sleep and anxiety.   I've just been really out of it honestly. Although the meds have helped I can still see signs that my depression and what has happened is still affecting me. Even though I may seem stable to others, I can tell I'm falling off and falling back into old habits. Hell I want to drink and just stay in my room for days. I dont want to go to work or to be burden to my friends or to even try to become a partner with the guy I'm talking too because fuck what if he turns out as abusive or what if sees just how fucked I am? Hell he knows I have CPTSD and take antidepressants. If he decides to give my insane ass a chance then its on him I guess.   Now I'm just rambling. Something else I noticed, before I typed this I started to cry. I havent cried for a good while so I guess this is good. I should cry and feel angry and feel hurt by this shit. Because its fucking bullshit that this little fucker of a monster know as CPTSD just got some more fucking power. Its such bullshit and I'm so tired. I dont want to die, I just want to rest. A nice hibernation so I dont have to deal with anymore shit."
OllieCad,17,"I dont understand this really when it comes to abuse, why do I miss this narcissistic abusive asshole after I just cut him completely? Am I craving the safety I felt or is my brain just that fucked up?  Like when he came back I drank for the first time in months, I began to have more panic attacks, dissociate more, question myself, overthink, be on edge all the time, emotional flashbacks and at times visual flashbacks out the ass. Now I want to go back to that shit? I want to go back to being such a fucking mess? Wtf?  Am I just crazy or has this happen to others here? If so how the fuck did you stop yourself from basically crawling back to the person who hurt you?"
OllieCad,17,"Im 22m and my first ever bf I had where I was somewhat open with was with a 53 year old dude. Breakup ended horribly with him accusing me of abusive being because I said ""Fuck you"" after an argument. An argument that happened because for a whole week he was depressed and didnt bother to tell anyone what was happening and just went ghost.   He has ptsd and I have cptsd, we both have abusive childhoods. After the breakup, therapy sessions, and being put back on antidepressants for me, he comes back after three months. We fool around a bit but then after a month things got bad. He went back to his bullshit and started to try and run shit which would cause me so many flashbacks. Until tonight because I told that fucker off and damn did it feel good. I was never the abusive, it was always fucking him. All the time.   Saying I had to be grateful because he would spend time with me, leaving me on read, never communicating what was wrong, never taking responsibility when he knew he did or say something wrong, and so much other shit. I dont understand how me a 22 year old punk is more emotionally fucking mature then some dude who is 53 and has been divorced fucking twice.   Fuck him and hope he dies in a god damn ditch. IM FREE BABY!"
PeteyZee1998,24," Since 2016 i have been struggling with this odd phenomenon that has caused me a world of turmoil, In 2016 i had a bad reaction to an anxiety attack, my reaction included severe dissociation, pacing around, as well as obsessing about it for up to a week, i experienced images of me pacing in my head, and it was stuck in a loop, during these episodes i would feel dissociation, extreme disconnection and detachment from reality, severe anxiety and distress. Eventually the images no longer occurred, instead i was than obsessing over the psychical sensations such as the dissociation, which all date back to that traumatic event for me. In 2017, i had episodes where i would just feel as if i had an ‘aura’ or almost as something was latched onto me, i would obsess over this sensation, to the point this sensation would cause even more dissociation. After taking a combination of Zoloft, Seroquel, Risperidone, i finally had solace in my life and no longer focused on these sensations. Some of the medications needed to be tapered, due to severe weight gain, and i would experience relapses, where i would again feel a weird ‘’stuck dissociative sensation’’ in my atmosphere, my reaction to these feelings was depression, distress, and i tried so hard to push it away. It led to a life of extreme distress"
PeteyZee1998,24,"What makes this an absolute wrecking ball is that I also have obsessive compulsive disorder and we know that’s hell too. That just makes it worse.   I had a severe bad reaction to a small event in 2016, and in that event I experienced a weird aura and severe dissociation, I now relieve the symptoms of that event but there is no memory stimulating this or even an image.   It’s highly distressing and drags you into a deep dark rabbit hole, it often leads to suicidal thinking, disinterest.   What’s helped me a lot is the use of medication but I’ve had a major relapse this week.   How do I accept the flashback?? How do I stop actively searching for it and trying to reason with it? Doing this just makes me feel even more dissociative and tense in the muscles"
PeteyZee1998,24,"   the victim here is my mother, My mother was in a emotionally abusive relationship with a diagnosed man with a certain disorder i do not wanna mention, she tries so hard and is in so much pain to explain to my sister the effects this abuse had to her brain, just how bad the insomnia is and the sweating,  Often to the point that she comes to me and says ''I don't know who will ever understand me, i feel like dying'' and i just give mom a big hug and tell her that i love her and understand her.  It's so painful watching my sister invalidate my mom, all she does is say ''you need to be stronger mentally, ive been through worse abuse than you!, you don't have CPTSD, people with CPTSD don't exist and that PTSD would land you in hospital if you ever had that. ''You're only problem is that you're lazy, like to sleep in and that you are a weak person with no resilience''"
OllieCad,17,"I have insomnia and most nights I dont go to sleep until like 3am and some nights I cant sleep at all then I finally go to sleep at like 9 or 10 am or even later at like 12pm. Honestly im somewhat afaird of sleep. Im afaird if I do sleep I will go through horrible nightmares of my abusers comimg back and hurting me, then I wake up in a panic and throwing punches and screaming. It sucks.  So I was wondering would sleeping with a stuffed animal and getting a weighted blanket help with this? Also does anyone here have both or either one to help with sleep or just calming themselves down? I take sleeping pills but at times even those don't help because I guess im just so full of anxiety that I cant just calm down somewhat. I think getting a stuffed animal and a weighted blanket can help at least make me feel safe because when I do feel safe I just get insta tired."
OllieCad,17,"I dont think I've talked about it here but last month I was able to get my first job and I love it actually! It's close to home, people there are nice, and I get to eat some good food as well. I'm a dishwasher and I honestly love it. I get to work in a kitchen and just basically like focus on just washing dishes or cleaning up and it's all nice really.   It is fast paced which Im fine with and I get to just be in my own bubble really so this is great. I have loving called myself a ""Neurotic Busboy"" after Muggy from Fallout NV Old World Blues (I love Muggy and Fallout so like it fits perfectly). Anyways I think this is success. I mean 15 bucks an hour for washing dishes isnt bad 😁"
OllieCad,17,"Something im starting to realize while forcing myself to go no contact with someone is that this is the first person/thing I've ever loved in years and have cared for deeply. Honestly for me it's incredibly hard to form bonds with anyone. When I try to, be it a freindship or relationship I just grow distant and have to force myself to continue contacting the other person and letting my guard down.   However when I do and I do in fact start to care I start to care too much and my fears are triggered. I fear many things and I let that take over without me honestly realizing it and it just fucks up everything, I become clingy and it pushes people away. In order to fix this I have to force myself to stop caring, to just stop giving a fuck.   When that happens and lets say I contuine to stay in contact with the other person I find myself unable to fully care about them anymore. Sure we stay in contact but I couldn't care less about you and your family because if I do that's a problem. But if I dont then that's also a problem.  I dont have a freaking middle ground and that's a problem. So wtf do I do here?"
OllieCad,17,"Im fucking tired. Just really tired. I can never just come home and sit down and just relax, I always have to do something. I cant just come home in a not great mood and just fucking be angry. I cant just say no to ordering food because if I do im always labeled as fucking selfish.   I really just want to say ""Piss off"" at times to EVERYONE. I really wish I had the ability to just completely not care about anyone or anything. Like even now im beating myself up and calling myself selfish or rude or not a good person because I went no contact with someone in order to just stop being so clingy. Im tired and just want some fucking peace honestly.  I just want to come home from work, take a shower, and then be left the fuck alone. Is that too much to fucking ask!?!?"
OllieCad,17,"Whenever I feel safe I become attached to whatever it is that makes me feel that way, its been a problem I've had since I was a kid. However this is a problem as it pushes people away and then that triggers my fear of abandonment and I panic.   Basically what do I do to stop this? To stop the panic and becoming to clingy? I hate this because it ruins so much and it fucking sucks. It once almost ruined a friendship I have and its now ruining my chances of having a potential partner. I have to fix this before its too late.   So what can I do?"
OllieCad,17,"Before I felt like I made several steps back on my path of healing. Relapsed twice with self harm, ex came back, that horrible night I had a mental breakdown fuled by rage, and just waking up mainly depressed and dealing with horrible thoughts damn near every day. But while I was in the shower tonight I realized something. I realized I am actually making progress.   I'm back on my medication, I have a job finally and I love it, I've been much more open with my friends, I've been gaining my weight and muscle back, my depression is under control, and I feel better now. I still have a long way to go but I feel good and feel like Im making progress everyday. It's a fight and it's tough but Im stubborn and want to enjoy life as best as I can.   I've been making plans on what to do as well in the future. Like get a drivers and motorcycle licenses, possibly get my own place, and maybe even socialize and stuff but the socializing will come later. Im not ready for that yet lol. For now Im just making baby steps I guess and Im fine with that. Means I'm still doing something to better my mental health and life and that is awesome af."
OllieCad,17,"Got off a good day at work and went to go wait for the bus as usual right? For some reason I get a bus driver who I guess has a stick up her ass or whatever. Most bus drivers are chill and just want to get work done and take you where ever you need to go, most bus drivers are fine with sitting in the back or whatever if you already paid and are just heading down town especially at night. Not this one though. Not fucking this one.   I said ""Just give me a transfer and I will use it for the ride for downtown"" no, has to lie and call her supervisor and say I'm a threat. I stormed off the bus, what does the supervisor do? Looks me in the face with a smile and says on his little radio "" Dont let this one person with a black hat and Nasa shirt on any buses"" and I flipped. It was almost 10 pm, Im off my meds, I just want to get home and get through this week till I can get my meds again but no. Fucking no. I screamed out:  ""THANK YOU! YOU GAVE ME A REASON TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF TONIGHT! WHEN I DO IT'S YOUR FUCKING FAULT!""   Not a good thing to say but I didn't care. I called my mom told her what happened, dude calls the cops, says the bus driver told him I didnt pay for both nights (I had a transfer to prove I did), says I was being a threat, and other shit. Cops talked to me, got me in an ambulance, and I got my meds again so thats good. I have to pick them up tomorrow. Im on my way home and Im just tired.   I thought I could make it to Friday, I felt good today but no. Nope. I swear and people say women cant be abusive towards men or whatever. No this bitch has thr nerve to call her supervisor on me and say that I threatened her and didn't pay. I did pay actually and YOU GAVE ME A TRANSFER TO PROVE I DID YOU STUPID BITCH. I didnt fucking threathen her or her supervisor I actually got off the bus for you, I threathen to kill myself actually fuckers.   Just like why? You know. Its the public bus, its almost 10 pm, I just want to go home. But no she has to treat me like a child (Im 22. What fucking child you know is comeing home at this time of night in work clothes????), take out her shitty day on me, make things complicated, lie, and just make things bad. Make everything bad. Honestly I just wanted to make it through Friday. I HAD to make it through Friday but no. Nope. It's always a fucking women. Always fucking is.  Edit: PLEASE CONTUINE BLAME ME IN THE COMMENTS! Go on. Please fucking do and tell me I fucking horrible and shouldn't be happy or alive. Please do. Please I dont fucking care."
OllieCad,17,"I havent been able to take my meds for about two weeks now (second week and I have an appointment on Friday) the reason why Ive been off them for so long was because I didnt have a relfill for them since I was just starting out on them. Well zoloft helps but since I've been off it I realised.......IM FUCKING INSANE WHEN OFF IT.  Seriously. They work wonders for depression but not great for anxiety and my moods which are caused by my bpd. Like I have been losing my fucking mind ever since I've been off them and have been doing things I never would have. I think I need to be heavily medicated in order to keep myself safe because dude this shit has been rough. I thought I would be fine because it's just two weeks but NOPE. I was so wrong.   If anyone here is on zoloft as well as other medications for anxiety and mood stabilizers please tell me, thank you in advanced."
OllieCad,17,"Um I think this goes into support but I'm still really suicidal and depressed for some reason. I thought that finally getting a job would make me happy which it did but like only while I was working. Now since Im done and going home I cant stop thinking really bad thoughts.  I dont get this, shouldn't I be happy now? Isnt that's how it suppose to go? I'm happy I have a job my first ever one and it's great for me. I'm dishwasher so like I can just space out and clean. I'm happy I'm making my own money and such but am I just not happy with life in general? Do I have to constantly be at work in order to not feel so hopeless?   Like I dont know how to explain it. I feel......empty. Like really empty. What do I do to not contuine to feel like this?"
OllieCad,17,"I'm not sure why I've started up again but I know I want to not let this continue any further. I haven't done this in years and yet I did it once out of impulse during the weekend and again last night because I just was so depressed? I dont know. I honestly didnt feel anything so I did it to feel something. My arm is bandage up and I told my friend what happened, he isnt mad at me but happy I told him.  I asked another friend if we can hang out during the weekend and do something fun so I can just get out this mindset. I also downloaded ""I am sober"" app to keep track because I'm hellbent on not doing this again. I guess seeing the pain your actions cause others really snaps you out everything and just makes you want to do and be better. Just life has been hitting me with so many punches all of a sudden and it all became too much but I'm fighter. I can do this.   I did for 5 years, so I know I can even longer."
OllieCad,17,"I'm just sitting here crying because I know I have to cut this person off completely but I dont know if I have the strength to do so. I just dont get why I'm not worth any effort or time or energy into just making things work in a relationship. Just everything really hurts and I dont know what to do honestly. He was my fp but I was just used for sex and thats it and I just should have known better, I really should have.   So how do you deal with this? It just hurts so much and I dont know what to do other then wanting to just hurt myself or worse because I really dont see a point in trying if this is all that happens. Any advice or support is very much appreciated and thank you to whoever comments."
carter_pride,46,They recently studied ptsd in animals.  Seems these issues are primal.  We aren’t the only ones who suffer.  https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210827-do-animals-suffer-from-post-traumatic-stress
OllieCad,17,I don't know what to do. Am I just here to be used by others for their own pleasure? I think that's the only reason why I'm even on this planet. Ever since I was kid it was either physical or verbal or sexaul abuse and it's no different now as an adult. I'm only 22 and I already want to fucking die because any time I even get close to someone I get used and left and then they return as if nothing happened. They are just fine but me it affects me so much I want to end everything but I just put a smile on my face to keep the peace.   I'm afaird of so much. I'm afaird to even show emotion or needs or wants or just to even ask what others think because if I do they always tell lies or yell or hit me or use me and I cant do anything because I'm so fucking weak and pathetic and just let it happen because if I don't I just end up getting hurt. Like always. I'm always one getting hurt everytime and I don't know what to do. I'm so tired of this bullshit but I cant help myself it seems.   I'm tired of being a people pleaser but I cant help it. I don't want to be alone and dont want people mad at me or ditch me but they do anyway no matter what I do because they all see me for what I am which is a demon who shouldn't be fucking happy at all. There's no point in trying to change. But what do I do?
OllieCad,17,"So today started off unexpectedly. I'm starting to feel good again and my depression has been well under check thanks to antidepressants, friends, family, and my therapist but then well my ex sent me a text out of nowhere. You know when you see something you forgot but then look at over and over and over again until it hits you and you just go ""Ah fuck, not again.""? Well that's what happened when I saw his number.   Panic, depression, anxiety, and overthinking pretty much came back at full force now I feel tired. I'm scared I'm going to keep feeling this way and that it will stop my progress, kinda almost feels like I took 100 steps back because I just didn't and still don't know how to handle the situation at all. So is this a set back or an obstacle? I know people here may have also dealt with this, not the same situation but the feeling you get when something or someone just comes back out of nowhere the moment you feel like you are actually healing then it just like.....feels like it creates a big giant mental block. Like a big ass wall or boulder that just appeared and you don't know what to do.   Talking to it won't work you'll just look crazy, punching it will only hurt and cause harm to you, and there seems to be no way around it so what now? You just sit there and stare at it waiting for some revelation or help. That's how this feels."
carter_pride,46,Smallest things - literally a scene about a party - and I’ll flashback to something mildly distressing at a party from 20+ years ago.  EVERYTHING has become a trigger in my life and I am constantly distressed by my thoughts.  It’s horrible.
OllieCad,17,"Because that's what happened to me last night. Basically yesterday was my birthday and so my current partner came to visit and spend the night over, everything was good until night hit and we were getting ready for bed. I just kept experiencing flashbacks of my past relationship and how different everything felt. I actually felt safe, I was treated nicely, my partner actually cared if I was okay or how I felt, he didn't try to hide the fact we were together when we went out to get food, and it was just nice. I just I guess broke down and finally just let it out I guess.   I felt like I could really, I felt that I could just let it out and cry and I was right. He didnt turn me away or made fun of me, he didn't tell me to suck it up or just forget about it. He understood that I have suffered trauma and a lot of it (childhood and now adulthood trauma). He let me cry and held me and let me talk when I wanted too and just let me I guess process it. I just cried so damn hard and let it out and I felt good afterwards. I felt horrible that I cried and got snot on his shirt but he didn't care and just told me he can just wash it when he gets back home, I apologized about crying and he said not worry because I needed it, and he just held me for the rest of the night.   I felt safe really. I felt I wasn't being made to do something I didn't want to or made to act a certain way when in public, I felt I could be myself. It felt good really."
OllieCad,17,I'm on the verge of tears because the person Im with no matter what I do or say or how I act he won't leave and keeps trying to make me happy and I just don't understand why. Why do this for someone like me? If I say I'm feeling a bit depressed or I had a rough day or I'm going through an episode he doesn't leave. He won't dismiss my feelings or try to change the subject or run away and leave me on read he actually tries to help and I just don't get why. I don't understand why either. I'm confused and scared because theres a voice in the back of my head telling me that this is a lie and that everything he is doing is to just get me to become attach to him so he can use me and then just drop me like others have.   I don't want to be like this or act like this yet I cant help but just keep my guard up because I'm scared. Really scared. Terrified really and I don't know what to fucking do. I'm a fucking demon who doesn't deserve this and it fucking hurts because I cant help but feel like this. What do I do? How can just be fucking normal for once and just let myself enjoy something healthy without feeling so fucking terrified it will all end up being a lie?
journey1992,11,"Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern?  I really liked this quote: ""Adults addicted to their own stress hormones were once  children who lived in unpredictable environments of overreaction, rage spirals, and fear. Healing is becoming conscious to when we unconsciously seek chaos, why we do it, and how often. With this awareness we can teach our bodies safety in the present."" -Dr. Nicole LePera https://www.instagram.com/p/CRuA4LrACjc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link  I notice when things get calm, I often will seek out chaos, look for problems or purposely trigger myself by thinking, reading or looking at things that have traumatized me. The I find myself in a trauma vortex where I keep triggering myself everytime I start getting calm. This dysregulated state excites and arouses me. It is familiar and makes me feel less bored. I have an underlying fear of getting better, fear of change, fear of getting my hopes up for it all to go bad again, and an underlying root belief that I don't deserve happiness and love because I am bad and unlovable.  Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern? How do you cope and stop yourself from going down that path? Also... Ugh doesn't it suck?? I feel like I am getting in my own way if healing even though I know it is deeper than that and I have to be patient."
OllieCad,17,"Holy shit I have waited years to finally say that! When I was 16 I was on antidepressants that never did shit and for years I thought antidepressants just weren't for me and that I was completely fine (Lie, I was basically forced off them by my mom because she said I didn't need them) but now since Im finally 21 I actually have power over this shit!   I was on lexapro for about a 2 months but they made me honestly feel blank, my depression got worse after having my dose increase, and I was having so many intrusive thoughts and flashbacks. Now I'm zoloft and even though I've only been on for a week I feel fucking great! I can actually sleep, my depression is finally under control, I have energy, and I can finally just feel good.   I'm just happy thar I finally have antidepressants that work for me!"
OllieCad,17,"I guess I need support or to feel not alone but am I weird? I'm 21 and I've only had sex with one person, I just cant do hook ups. The thought of it just disgust me because I'm just being used like how I was used as a child so I just feel gross and disgusted with myself. Not to say that's how I view people who do hook ups as but for me I just cant.  When it's with a partner then sure that's fine but even then my quiet bpd can make me split and feel disgusted with even having sex them (not disgusted with them but just the thought of sex disgust me) but for the most part as long as it's with a partner then it's fine. I understand this is definitely my sexual trauma from childhood being a cause of these feelings but I can't help think this way."
OllieCad,17,"I understand that's a fucked thing to say but it's something that I've been doing these past few months since everything resurfaced. I have ADD, PTSD, Quiet BPD, major depression, and anxiety. All that shit just combines and forms this fucked up demon who is just trying to live and be a good person. I find it kinda funny really while I was thinking this the other day. I'm a good person I think and I try my best but after everything that has happened it's kinda hard to believe that.  I mean I understand that non of this is my fault, it's not my fault I basically became a fucked up Pokemon who evolved into this person but it's hard not to think I'm a demon. It's hard not to feel shame and guilt over things that happened to me as a child, things that were out of my control and I had no power to fight against. It's all so weird really.  I can say that it wasn't my fault and I understand it isn't but there's a small part of me that just refuses to believe it. I can say I'm a good person who deserves to be happy but that small part can't believe it and is in fact terrified of being happy. It's draining really and makes me want to slam my head into a wall most days."
OllieCad,17,I think this is me splitting or going crazy but most days I love how caring and affectionate my partner is since Im also a very caring person and do like affection but then some days I fucking hate it. I'm disgusted by it and want nothing more then to just slam my head into wall if I see another fucking stupid ass heart eyes emoji. I don't understand why either. I either wake up feeling like my normal empathetic and loving self but other days I feel apathetic and hate everything and I mean hate.
OllieCad,17,"Can I not just be use to things? Can I not just be fucking knowledgeable on things!?!? It's not like I'm just getting triggered or splitting at will or causing flashbacks or not trying to enjoy the relationship or choosing to not be open or trying to retraumatize myself over and over and fucking over again. I just want a damn break for fuck sakes. I want to be given time to fucking just accept what the fuck happend to me as a child and what has happened to me 6 fucking months ago. So Im sorry if I don't say ""I love you"" or something while going through a fucking episode. Just fuck off for a moment and let me just cry and act I don't know apathetic for moment or something. Fucking just FUCK OFF ALREADY PLEASE.   Jesus christ. Just let me think and calm down and just let my brain turn off for a moment. I don't want to be sweet or nice or put on a smile at this time and I just want to feel these negative emotions and just act cold for a moment. Cold to the world and to others because I just need to think and cry."
OllieCad,17,"I've never been this depressed before in years. It's like a constent emptiness and tiredness that I haven't felt in such a long time, it's such a strange feeling. I haven't had any energy to do anything. I missed two therapist appointments, I can't even talk to friends for long periods of time (in fact I get annoyed by them and everything else in the world quickly now), I can't hold conversations with my partner, I cant watch tv, I can't play video games, the thought of going outside scares the shit out of me, and I cried after looking at my skateboard because I haven't used it in months. I have no energy to focus on or to do anything.  Why is it that I feel happy for only a little while then become just depressed afterwards? I've mainly just been a crying, overly sensitive, exhausted, and angry person these three months. I just don't feel anything positive. Why is it that for three months I was happy and now for three months I guess I'm gonna be full blown depressed? I'm not even excited about going to see my partner this weekend. Nothing in life at this moment in time is making me happy to live and I don't know why? Maybe this is the price I pay for thinking I could feel human for a bit.  This to has be hell really. Flashbacks, insomnia, emptiness, worthlessness, and sucidal thoughts for these three months. For fuck sake if this is the price for feeling happy, truely fucking happy for only three months then I rather not be happy for the rest of my damn life. This is bullshit. Such incredible fucking bullshit and I'm tired honestly. Really tired.   Happy I forced myself to at least write this, now my head hurts. Fucking hell give me a break."
OllieCad,17,"So I told my partner what's been going on with my head basically, for some reason something must have triggered me or it's my antidepressants not doing the job but my depression has gotten worse and so have my flashbacks. I've just been drained and sleeping most of the time because I have no energy really, I told my partner this and he said he'll do his best to support me.   Honestly thought I would get the same reaction I got from my ex which was being left on read but no he actually asked if I was okay, any triggers I may have, and what he can do to help. Which to be honest left me stunned I guess. I wasn't expecting that and had no clue what to say except ""Thank you"". I haven't had this kind of support from a romantic partner in years and it feels good."
OllieCad,17,"I can barely write and think. I've been so exhausted really, just physically exhausted. I haven't been able to sleep and like actually rest from some time now, I'm just so sick of this. I wish healing would be faster or I wish there was a guide on how my brain works so I can find the right plug or switch to my emotions and memories then just cut the cord or flip the switch to off .   Just turn off everything and go numb to all of it. I dont want to feel really. I want to just either go completely numb or lock myself in my room for months and sleep. Be a mental health hibernation, sleep and when I wake up I'll be happy. I won't feel like crying almost everyday, I won't feel disgusted about my feelings, I won't feel so pathetic, and I won't feel like such a burden to everyone. Just wake up from a much needed rest and be fixed.   I feel so horrible that the guy Im with decided to give this mess a fucking chance. I don't want him to see me like this really but I can't just hide or fall off the face of the earth you know. He doesn't deserve that.  Man this all sucks."
OllieCad,17,"Have you ever woken up from a failed suicide attempt and then just feel angry? I took sleeping pills hoping to overdose and then woke up today at 6pm. It's almost 2am and I'm just angry at myself for fucking failing at something that should be completely fucking easy! JUST FUCKING GIVE UP ALREADY FOR FUCK SAKES! Heart attack, brain aneurysm, stroke, I don't fucking know but christ sakes why won't I fucking die!?!? I'm tired. I'm angry. I'm fucking disgusted at myself for just not giving into death in my sleep because now I have to look in the mirror and see the same fucking DEMON WHO SHOULD HAVE FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT!   Why won't my body just give up? Why can't I fully give up? Why do I keep fighting? I don't understand. Maybe I don't want to but dont want to believe it I guess. I don't know. It's like I'm 16 all over again and I failed the exact same way only difference is I'm not suppressing my memories and emotions. Growth I guess. It's kinda funny in a really morbid and fucked up way and also extremely sad and I want to cry but also laugh because I failed. I'm angry and also somewhat happy I did. I sound crazy but it's better to type this out then just hold it in."
OllieCad,17,"Someone please tell me what did I do wrong to desever the abuse I went through as a child? What did I do wrong? I'm only 21 years old and I just don't want to live anymore really. Im crying right now while typing this because I just don't understand why. Why did these things happen to me? What's wrong with me or what did I do wrong to desever any of the abuse I went through as a child?   I just keep asking why and I just keep thinking over and over and over again the things said to me by people who were suppose to live me. ""A disgrace, a disappointment, a mistake, and abusive. You dont deserve to live"" that's all I can think now and I dont want to die. I don't want to hurt others and I don't want to be hurt anymore. I never would have become abusive to my ex after just one outburst, I never would have hurt him. All I said was ""Fuck you"" and now I'm abusive. I don't want to hurt others and I never have wanted too. I'm not like that at all.   I just want to be human. I just want to feel human and happy and safe but whenever I do I get hurt. I don't want to die but I don't want to live anymore because I'm so tired and scared. I'm a good person, I was a good kid. What did I do to desever this? I try my best to make sure others are happy and to not be selfish or rude. I'm trying my best to just live but why should I if I'm all those things.   Before I die at 22 because I know for a fact I won't live past that age I just want to feel human one more time. I just want to be seen as human and be seen as a good person, I just want to be loves and not used then just thrown aside like I'm worthless. I don't want to die feeling like a worthless demon who never asked for any of the abuse I suffered as a child.  I'm sorry if this post is all over the place but I'm just so tired and haven't slept at all. I'm afaird to sleep because of the nightmares and I've just been so on edge this week that I feel like a ticking a time bomb just waiting for something to happen so I can finally have a reason to end everything, I don't want to die yet but I'm so tired of this fucking pain I keep feeling and it's driving me mad."
journey1992,11,"I (30/Female) have an extensive child and adulthood sexual abuse history. Since I was a child, I had fantasies of being tied up and assaulted because of my own trauma. I would get turned on by watching movies where other women were assaulted. I used to place myself in dangerous situations and with predators where I knew I would be assaulted due to trauma reenactment. Up until recently, I used to watch violating porn which made me scared, bothered but also turned on. These emotions were confusing and felt like self-betrayal for mainly getting turned on by predators violating others or myself when deep down it scared me and I did not like it.   When I see a woman who reminds me of myself (similar personality, looks and/or seems very vulnerable), I will intrusively project sexual abuse thoughts and stories/fantasies of what happened to me onto her.  Not because I am necessarily attracted to her (sometimes yes) and not because I want to harm her. But it is my brain and body's way of processing and trying to understand what happened to me. By studying her, I can understand why I was preyed on, why it happened to me, and heal by working through it. I know this is my mind and body's way of processing what happened to me but it makes me feel dangerous and ashamed. This does not happen all the time of course, but there have been times I have avoided women due to feeling triggered and creepy. I think sometimes there have been women who have picked up on it and seemed creeped out.  A lot of time, I will study characters in movies or celebrities that remind me of myself and my trauma history.   Recently, I started working for someone who I found out had a similar trauma history to me. Then I noticed I because really afraid of sexualizing her like my dad did once to me.. not because I was attracted to this woman and not because I would hurt her but my intrusive thoughts were my body trying to process what happened.. which of course was not the appropriate time to do so. I really worked hard to suppress those thoughts and I'm so exhausted from suppressing them and the fear of by mistake sexualizing her or someone else because my body is trying to process what happened. Another example is recently I was at an spiritual retreat where a predator man sexually harassed me the whole time. Then at the end of the retreat, I ate breakfast with a woman I didn't know very well, was way older than me, and I was not attracted to her... but I started to check her out like that predator was at the retreat. Not because I was attracted to her but it literally was my body's way of processing what was happening to me and in that moment I was so open, shaken up and didn't have the best self control after the spiritual retreat.  I am really struggling with the shame, guilt, and feeling like a creepy person that needs to be kept away from people. Anyone relate? Support and validation always welcome."
OllieCad,17,"I thought before lexapro was working for me, it mainly just helps with anxiety it seems for me but doesn't help with my depression like at all. It's worsen my insomnia as well, I'm on 20mg and I was hoping the higher dose would help but no. In fact I think it's just making my depression worse really. I stopped taking them for two days (I know not good) but I don't like feeling so blank, It's either depression or rage or nothing. So what would be a good antidepressant?   Also if anyone has any advice on how to deal with random rage episodes that would be great too. My rage is mainly suppressed but then I explode over the littlest things or over nothing. I don't know what to do and luckily I havent exploded on friends or family or on my partner. I'm just so filled with this anger that wants to destroy everything and it's terrifying and fucking irritating as all hell."
OllieCad,17,I dont understand wht I'm about to have a sucidal breakdown the night before my therapist appointment but here we go. I keep thinking over and over again how fucking worthless I am for some fucking reason and its pissing me the fuck off! I don't understand why whenever I feel some sort of happiness it goes away immediately and then depression sets in. Maybe it's my meds or am I just afaird to be happy or both? I think both.   Honestly lexapro is fine as it helps with my anxiety but my depression seems to have gotten worse I think after being put on 20mg. I think it's because I can barely sleep which means for most days I'm just a walking corpse trying to fit in and be productive. There's that and I just can't stop feeling like I don't deserve to be happy at all.  I don't get this. Why am I so fucking depressed? I shouldn't be and I should be happy but for some damn reason I can't be and it's infuriating.
OllieCad,17,"I feel like I shouldn't be in the relationship I'm in at times. It's good,the person I'm with is patient and understands that my mind isnt the best at times which is good. But it's like I'm split in half about this. One half is happy about this while the other half feels disgust over it, I feel like I don't deserve this. To be with someone who is mentally healthy and caring.   At times I miss my controlling ex because of this and it's all confusing. I tell myself that I deserve to be happy and I feel like I should but I guess I dont actually believe that I deserve to be happy. I dont believe I deserve something that is healthy and it's frustrating as all hell.   I guess when your most of your not long life (I'm 21m) is filled with abuse and trauma you just being to believe that you don't deserve happiness or to ve cared for or to be loved by others. Especially from those who are mentally healthy which is well bullshit honestly."
journey1992,11,"I'm stuck between wanting to cover up and protect myself from men vs. wanting to look pretty and date  I used do everything for male validation. I had to look nice because male disapproval and rejection was the worst. I ate right and exercised for the goal of finding a boyfriend. I flirted with men and loved attention that i now see was from a lot of creepy and predatory men. I was doing a lot of trauma reenactment when I was with abusive men without realizing it.  Then I realized I had been sexually abused for years in my early 20's and unrepressed childhood sexual abuse memories were revealed in my late 20's. I haven't waxed in three years. I haven't dated in more years. I lost weight and my curved. I wear baggy conservative clothes. I suppress my sexuality a lot and changed my walk to appear unattractive and i am always rushing away. I do my hair maybe once a week. I avoid, set boundaries and am mean to guys who show interest. I run away from people and avoid eye contact. Most parts of me hate attention---it's not safe. I am safer now, I don't really get attention. I don't really look too attractive. Some creeps this year tried but I've become really good at setting boundaries quick, repelling them and running away.   At my job, a client talked about how she started going out and dressing up. I felt some sadness and envy. I definitely felt shame for the envy and tried to suppress it.. but I am human and it is making me realize there is a part of me I shut down in order to feel safe. I part of me wants to look pretty and date. But that feels so dangerous. I also feel insecure wondering if I can get to be as attractive as I used. Sometimes I take care of myself to look pretty and get into my feminine energy then it attracts men.. then it scares me and I do things (like lose weight or eat inflammatory foods or don't do my hair) to make myself look less attractive.   When I do start dating and dressing up, it will be so different than it was before. I changed for the best in a lot of ways because for the most part, I seek validation from myself now. But there is still a part of me that wants some attention.  Who relates? Any support or encouragement?"
OllieCad,17,"I passed with an 80 and I'm proud of myself honestly! These past few months have been tough honestly childhood trauma coming back, first sexual relationship ended horribly (ex was controlling and manipulative), battling alcohol addiction, and dealing with finding out I possibly have ptsd and quiet bpd (therapist thinks I do but wants to do more sessions before diagnoses) has been a tough and draining experience.   But I did it! I passed and I'm proud of myself. Proud of myself for passing, proud that I haven't drank in 2 months, proud I resched out for help, and proud that I have been trying to just heal from everything."
OllieCad,17,"I think I'm starting to become afraid of sleeping due to the recent nightmares I've been having.   The nightmares are about the physical abuse I suffered as a child and always are usually the same. My abuser grabs my my neck, I freak out, and then I wake up screaming and throwing punches into my bed or in the air. They always seem so real too, like I can feel the pressure on my neck and it just sends me in a such a panic I freeze for a moment in my nightmares.I froze in one of them after the person grabbed my neck and started to squeeze. I just froze completely until I snapped out of it and instantly started clawing at their arms, throwing punches, and screaming until woke up.  After waking up I just sat in my bed panting, sweating, shaking, and just terrified. I haven't had a good nights rest for a while now and just been pumping energy drinks into my body, I feel like I'm back in art school again. I just feel so exhausted and my body feels heavy, it just wants to relax and finally get some rest."
OllieCad,17,"Basically I've met someone who is very nice, sweet, understanding, and best part he's around my age which is great. He understands that I possibly have cptsd (not yet diagnosed but my therapist believes I have ptsd and quiet bpd) and he's chill with it. I want to be with him honestly however I'm really terrified of becoming close with him and opening up again to someone since the last person I was with turned out to be controlling and manipulative at times.   I'm trying not be scared of becoming close with someone again however I can't help it, it feels like I'm pushing away even though I don't want to at all. In all honestly I feel like I shouldn't be with him because he's so nice and understanding, I feel like I don't deserve that if that makes any sense. So my question is to those here who are in relationships how have you managed these feelings? The feeling of not being worthy of a healthy relationship as well as how did you learn to become close with someone again?"
OllieCad,17,"Honestly that's depressing.   Whenever I try to I just see nothing. I see a black void and thats it. I don't see me being in a happy family, having a successful career, having good friends, or anything like that. I just don't. I don't know why either? I'm only 21 so it is honestly depressing I guess.   I mean I have good friends already, im doing good in school, and I've been talking to someone new who I am into but I just still can't see myself living past 22 though. I guess I'm trying to find a reason to make it and live past that age but I can't find one honestly and that's honestly terrifying. I don't want to die and I do want to live but I just don't have a reason too as of now I guess and I'm desperately in search of one."
OllieCad,17,"I don't know why but I found it odd when this morning I started to cry while experiencing flashbacks from my childhood, it was a flashback to when I was sexual abused at 4 years old by my mothers boyfriend at the time. I just couldn't close my eyes because when I did I just saw his face and I started crying. Something I've never done before since I've been experiencing these flashbacks.   I usually hate crying because when I did as a kid I was told to shut up to go away and since I'm a guy well I guess crying will always be seen as me being weak so I guess that's why I found it odd that I started too. I don't know really. So is it odd to cry while having flashbacks? Do any of you do it?"
OllieCad,17,"Damn. Who would of thought getting your lip busted, having your head slammed into walls, being choked, being punched repeatedly as you try to cover you face, and also having your head bounced off a FUCKING DVD PLAYER would make me fucking terrified of physical violence and well anger in general.  Sorry I'm not like the rest of my siblings who aren't afraid to fight, I'm the one who was born ""soft"". Sorry mom.   Fucking hell had to let that out, like really? You did all that shit to me as I grew up and you wonder why I hate fighting and can't fight others."
OllieCad,17,"I haven't had a drink in two months! HELL YEAH!   Had to stop drinking really. Been drinking since I was 15 and since mixing antidepressants with alcohol can be a pretty damn horrible combination, yeah it was time to stop really.   Anyways proud of myself honestly, really am proud of myself."
OllieCad,17,"You feel good about yourself, better then you felt in years or you get away from your abusers or you finally feel free of everything then *BAM*  the bullshit starts.  The panic attacks, stress, overthinking, dissociation, depression, feeling worthless, hopeless, to exhausted to do anything, headaches out the ass, body just feels sluggish, can't sleep, can't eat, you just can't fucking function.   Just some straight bullshit."
OllieCad,17,"The good ones make me feel somewhat ashamed because I repressed them along with the bad ones since they were in places where my abuse happend but I'm also somewhat happy I remember them. I can remember a time where I felt happy which is great.   I can say that I was truly happy at some point in my life and I haven't always felt empty and worthless,  it's like a strange relief really and it gives me some hope I guess even though I have a hard time seeing a future. Hell I don't even think I'll live past 22 half the time really. I'll be surprised if I do though."
OllieCad,17,"I feel myself slipping back into the pit each day. The pit is basically my depression. Each day I find it hard to do things like getting up from bed, eating, reading, watching tv, playing video games, staying focus in class, and other stuff. I'm mainly just exhausted most of the time. I get random moments were I just become enraged or depressed or even at times suicidal, I'm trying to keep myself at least somewhat sane until I can see my therapist but man is it hard. I have friends who keep me grounded and music that's helping me concentrate on things but even then it just becomes hard to enjoy those things as well.  I don't like this really. Feeling so tired and empty. It's just honestly terrifying at times because I'm afaird of waking up in the pit and never coming out of it."
OllieCad,17,I never really had true friends. Most kids just kept me around and used me as a punching bag or for things so now at 21 I finally have two true friends. People who I trusted enough to tell them what's been going on and both told me they loved me.  I'm trying not to cry right now but it's just so good to hear that and to feel cared for especially now when I feel so just drained and empty. I feel cared for and it just feels so fucking good man.  I'm just really grateful to finally have friends like this. Friends that I've wanted for years and I finally have them and I love them both so much.
OllieCad,17,"I started taking it around 4 or 5 weeks ago to help with depression and anxiety, I'm on 10mg at the moment and it does somewhat help me calm down I just mainly feel well blank. Like I feel really well nothing. I do still get very depressed at times and my insomnia has seem to have gotten worse. I'm not sure if that's what it's suppose do. Like I laugh at times but for the most part I either feel nothing, anxiety, or depression.   I don't feel happiness or energy really. I just feel nothing. At times I feel okay but then that goes away as fast as I feel it so I'm honestly confused. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow so I will ask but I also want to ask here to see if anyone feels like this."
OllieCad,17,"If I could describe how I'm feeling now it would be it's like a monster is holding me trapped. The monster formed in that box that was in darkest corner of my mind. I completely forgot many many memories and just kept the box back there but it's like the relationship triggered it. Like the box opened and the monster slowly started to crawl out of it.   Just sat and waited until I was vulnerable and then it took it's chance when I felt myself start to fall for him. Then it latched onto me. It's still latched onto me but the hold feels somewhat weakened. The antidepressants and therapy are helping by not letting it completely consume me. That's what it what's to do. Consume me whole and take control but I can't let it, if I do then I don't know what I can do.  This monster is all of my trauma formed into one. All of it and even though the hold is weak it's still whispering in my ear, making me more on high alert and more just terrified of the world. I carry a pocket knife with me now, whenever I see a car that looks like my ex's I have to do a double take, I'm much more irritable, and my emotions don't feel like mine at times. I sometimes just completely dissociate at random times in the day and night. When I look in the mirror I see a demon most of the time looking back at me.  I'm emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausted. I know I can do this and heal but at times I just want to slam my head into a wall over and over again to give me physical pain so I can focus on that. I know I have to take this slow and not to rush it which I'm trying so hard not to do but this fight is tough. It's a fight for life it feels like and I have to win.  I can do this. I know I can. I know I fucking can and I will."
OllieCad,17,"So I may possibly have BPD......great. Just great. So lets see depression, anxiety, ADD, BPD, and PTSD.  Holy shit I keep evolving like a fucked up ass Pokemon! While I was reading the symptoms more memories started to pop up back in my head to my frist ever relationship were I truly loved someone and man I did some fucked up things. From drinking, to suicidal episodes, stealing, fighting, constant anger, explode over little things, emotions went from happy to terrified to depressed for days, sending nudes, being overly clingy, always insecure, going out late at night and destroying shit, believing therapy was a waste of time, over taking antidepressants, and so much more. Man I really am a fucking demon aren't I? So happy he left my ass. God I'm happy that my recent relationship ended before it all this popped the fuck back up.  Fuck me. Man I wish I never got into another relationship because for the love of fucking god I want all of these memories to go back in the god damn box that was shoved into the darkest corner of my fucking mind. Christ sakes I'm so fucking angry at myself for being this god damn fucked in the head! Why!?! Why the fuck did I have to get a fucked up ass childhood!?! Why do millions of people have to suffer from shit like this when we NEVER FUCKING ASKED FOR IT IN THE FIRST GOD DAMN PLACE!  People say ""Well the experience made you strong"" well fuck that and fuck you. I needed someone to protect me and keep me god damn safe when I was only 4 fucking years old from my ""step father"" (dude was a fucking sicko) and from my cousin from the ages of 6 to 10. Made me strong and made my head all fucked. All of it.   Fuck me this hurts. Hurts alot. A whole damn lot."
OllieCad,17,"Because that's what I'm doing right now! I'm in the bathroom of my school and after realizing that I was shaking. Still am. Schools are kinda like a trigger for me I guess you can say. I never feel safe in them because of the years of bullying (physical and verbal abuse daily) so Im always on alert. Don't know why because its fucking college and were all adults but still humans are humans and some are SHIT.  Anyways I'm shaking, my heart is racing, hard to concentrate, hard to breath, and in the bathroom to calm myself down a little. Had to write this because writing this stuff down helps me think and look at my emotions. Helps me feel human I guess? I don't know."
OllieCad,17,"I was 16 when my ex said that too me. 16, depressed, anxiety filled, angry, and tired me thought ""Nah. My trauma wasn't that bad."" After telling him about a flashback to when my sexual abuse started when I was 4. Fast forwarded to now, I'm 21 and recently dumped due to an outburst. First ever sexual relationship and it brought back years of trauma I all but forgotten and I hide it like before, had an outburst, got dumped, immediately regret everything, try to smother everything like before and I can't because that one memory keeps playing in my head on loop!  It's like it's my brain saying ""Yo look, shit isn't right. Alcohol and abusing antidepressants aren't cutting it anymore. Get some help."" I feel guilty for the outburst because the person I was with has ptsd and my therapist said that my outburst could have possibly triggered something, he was also off his medications and coming back from depressive episode which triggered my own depression and anxiety in full force. We both weren't in great states of mind. So I have to fix this or try too. I feel so guilty for a lot of things and the main source of guilt is not getting this checked out sooner before I met my ex. I fell for him because he made me feel safe and I just can't lose someone I fell for again like I did last time I guess.  I guess that's the reason why this memory just keeps playing over and over again. Reminding me that something isn't right and that I have to get this checked before I decide to try and explain things when I myself am confused."
OllieCad,17,Might as well offer some support right? If you're like me and think you have ptsd but can't contact your therapist or are looking for one or if you have been diagnosed already with ptsd I would suggest keeping a journal. It's honestly been helping me as a wait for an appointment and try to push myself to make one (I'm honestly a little afraid to make appointment 😅) I can organize my thoughts a lot better and keep myself from overthinking to death as well as explain how I feel during certain things like when I wake up feeling crappy or when I suddenly feel a sense of panic.   Not to mention keeping a journal can help if you're also like me and can't really talk about certain traumas. For me my throat feels like it's closing up if I try to explain what happened with words so writing down is pretty much my best option for me.
OllieCad,17,"Today I woke up feeling somewhat empty. You know those days where you just wake up feeling like you're empty and floating? It's like you just phase through the day and everything is a blur. One moment you're in bed, the next you're on the bus heading to class, then next thing you know you're back at home just sitting in your room tired. So emotionally tired. That's today.  I just don't feel like me. I don't like this. I want to cry but afraid too honestly, I just keep thinking over and over again how I have to fix this. I made myself promise to myself that I will try to call my therapist tomorrow to scheduled an appointment. I can't keep running from this, I just can't."
OllieCad,17,"You see due to the trauma I've experienced as a kid I've never truly felt safe anywhere. I've never felt safe at my house, a family members house, a friends house, at school, with friends, with family, basically no one or no where. But when I do get my frist taste of safety I instantly become attached.  I only ever felt safe in my room, at one of my friends house, at my exs place, and whenever I was with my ex in general I felt safe. I basically become like a child and just want to be there or with them as much as possible. Feeling safe is such a weird and nice feeling that it terrifies me because I rarely have ever felt it and when I do I just want to feel it all the time.   What's odd is that when I do feel safe with someone or somewhere I instantly become tired which is odd. It's like my body telling me ""Hey you know you don't have to be on constat alert here, we can rest and just relax."" Maybe I'm just weird or something idk but does anyone else feel this or have felt this?"
OllieCad,17,"Hm I feel like mental state is getting god damn worse each day. I woke up from a nightmare that had me screaming and swinging my arms, just throwing punches at nothing. In my nightmare it was so....odd. Like all my abusers just morphed into one and then wrapped there hands around my throat. Telling me they were just waiting. Waiting to see me fail. That set me off and I lost it.  It was terrifying. I mean I failed at a fucking relationship so now what? Fail at my school or fail in life in general? I don't know. But man not a great way to start the day."
OllieCad,17,"I have never felt human or like a good human being I guess. I've always felt like I never really mattered after what I've been through and what has been said too me. The sexual abuse made me feel like a toy, the physical abuse made me feel like a punching bag, and verbal abuse has made me feel like a sponge who just soaks up everyone's words but can't let them go. I'm a disgrace to my mother, a disappointment, a mistake, and apparently someone who would have become abusive to my ex after one outburst I immediately regretted.   I just don't feel like a person. I kinda feel like Im well nothing. Like just a ball of mass that just keeps living for some odd reason. Idk."
OllieCad,17,"Is it weird that whenever I try to talk about the sexual abuse I went through I start to panic a bit? Like I can say ""I was sexual abused as a child"" like its nothing but if I try to describe what happened I feel sick to my stomach. I tense up, my heart goes crazy, I feel like throwing up, I want to cry, and it's just panic. Like I can't describe it.   I feel so disgusted trying to talk about it. It's just like pain I guess if that makes sense. Like I can't force myself to talk about it but I feel like I have to talk about it in order to get past it, so how do I talk about it? Do I just force myself to do it?"
OllieCad,17,"I remember back when I was 16 my boyfriend at the time said ""I think you may have ptsd"" the reason he said it is because he's the only person who knew about my childhood trauma. Sexual abuse, physical abuse, and verbal abuse which I still suffer flashbacks from to this day. But me being a dumb teen thought ""No. No way I'm that messed in the head"" but now I think he's right.   I'm 21 now and I was looking at the signs. From flashbacks, reckless behavior, anxiety, depression, and many other things that I did back when I was 16 and even now. When I was 16 I would skip school all the time, anytime I could drink I would, I would lie, steal, and so much more. Now at 21 I don't do that now but after a recent breakup I have started to lose myself it feels like. You see it was my frist ever sexaul relationship and we recently broke up mainly because my past trauma started to resurface. Flashback after flashback and I hated it. I didn't know how to tell my partner and now I'm pretty sure he hates me because of how it ended. Anyways, I'm starting to notice I'm doing exactly what I did back when I was 16 but worse now since Im of age so I started to see a therapist and started to retake antidepressants as well to maybe help. Now how do I maybe ask for a diagnoses? Is there a form or I just talk about my trauma/my past and we go from there?   Also if I do have it which I'm pretty sure I do, how do you cope with it? I'm terrified that to be diagnosed and I dont know what to do."
journey1992,11,"A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf!  So I did a virtual appointment with two spiritual people who guide plant medicine spiritual sessions for healing. My main purpose was to ask them more about how they could help me and the different types of Spiritual ceremonies they hold. I spent over one hundred dollars to get more information about them and they barely answered my questions.  First, they ask me about why I am looking to work with the medicine. I tell them childhood sexual, racial and mental trauma. Then I tell them how I am looking for safe spaces because unfortunately I've been getting preyed on by predators in these spaces. He asks for more details about the predator experience and asks if the predator flirted with me. I briefly summarize what happened then change the subject by discussing some of the positives of the past spiritual events I went to. Then he keeps asking me for more details about the trauma and my intentions, but I continue to give vague answers because This spiritual healing work is pretty personal, independent and you actually don't need to tell your guides the specifics of your trauma. He kept pushing and I tell them I don't feel comfortable sharing my childhood sexual abuse especially because I just met them and this work is personal and knowing the details of my trauma is not necessary. I ask them what is their purpose of wanting to know? They say ""it will help him figure out what intentions I should set and what ceremonies are best for me."" He continues pushing and asks if I have a therapist? I tell him that I've been in therapy for years and also have a degree in psychology/counseling.  Then he says we are just souls that pick up stories (trauma).. So then why was he so persistent of hearing about my trauma when he is saying it doesn't matter so much?!    They wasted my time, it was obvious they hadn't read the form I was told to complete beforehand for them because he said ""next time you will have to fill out the form and we will discuss what ceremonies are best for you."" I told them ""I already filled out the form and did they read it?"" Then the female leader was like oh yes. Obviously they didn't otherwise they wouldn't have been asking questions that  were already answered on there. Then he kept filling up the time with random psychological information (and he is not a trauma trained individual) about our brain being stuck in child trauma.. it's like they were just trying to fill up time because they were unprepared. Then he tries to tell me I am not allergic to mushrooms and it is just anxiety. He was acting like he was all knowing and knew what was best for me and he had just met me!   He told me to stop being logical and get in touch with my intuition. When I told them I would want to do the healing work in women spaces due to my trauma, he said he couldn't change himself into a woman.. so basically Id be stuck with him as a guide.  Then he tells me I need to work on surrendering because I am hyperprotective. I told him I did struggle with surrendering and he asked why. I said it was hard to give up control because of past trauma. He said control is all a perception and I needed to surrender.  He tells me predators I've been harassed by recently have been attracted to my energy due to my struggle of surrendering. He says ""everyone has childhood trauma and you shouldn't come to just take.. When you come to group meetings, you need to open up and give and take.. you should come with a nonjudgmental ear."" He tells me he doesn't think I am ready for a spiritual ceremony soon and that I need to do gentle things like yoga and find small ways to surrender. He says next time I come I have to be willing to share everything about me. WTH!!! So I am being ""judgemental and just taking"" because I set boundaries and don't want to unnecessarily share my childhood trauma to strangers?! Notice how they are using ""surrender"" to push boundaries?!  How disappointing that he tried to shift the blame on me when they were the ones who were unprepared and prying personal information by pushing boundaries! I feel mad and triggered. He shamed me for setting and sticking with my boundary. I also feel proud because I've come so far that I set and stick to my boundaries. The fact that someone is telling me I need to open up tells me I've progressed because I used to be called an open book! Not everyone gets the privilege of knowing my trauma...that may come once trust is established.  ugh!! Validation and support would be nice, thank you."
journey1992,11,"Ugh, I am so frustrated that I was groomed by society to think stalking, predator and abusive behavior was normal and romantic!!  Rape culture is real and everyone is in on it-- abusers, enablers, bystanders, and the media. Most romantic movies I have seen has an element of predatory or abusive behavior. They brainwashed and groomed me and other women so much. I was groomed to stop listening to my gut and discomfort around the behavior and was taught I was lucky, special and beautiful to be experiencing the abuse. This year has been a lot of work of unlearning this grooming and seeing how I was used and how making me feel special is all part of the grooming process. It doesn't mean I am not special or beautiful, it's just that it is not flattering to be preyed upon by predators who don't really love me--not in a healthy way. They saw me as an object to satisy their needs until they got bored/ discarded me and found someone else. My pedophilic dad did that to me. NEVER AGAIN.  Sick! I am so mad!!"

journey1992,11," TW: Child sexual abuse   I'm struggling to see how I can ever really be happy again now  that I know I was molested/raped as a baby and little girl? #unrepressed memory  I suspected I was abused for many years, the signs were all there and there were plenty of pedophiles in my family with two that paid extra attention to me, dad and my cousin who was 13 years older than me. I thought the attention and affection they gave me was because they loved me but really were grooming me to fulfil their desires and sexual needs. They made me feel special and beautiful so I kept seeking their validation long after they discarded and devalued me. A repressed memory was shown to me at an spiritual experience. I was molested and raped when I was young enough to be in a crip frequently by my cousin, brother, doctor and probably my mom. My mom got joy out of seeing me in pain and encouraged my sexualization all the way until I was an adult and went no contact. She didn't protect me, of course not.. her sociopathic sadistic desires wouldn't be met. I also was shown my psychopathic brother (one year older) also molested me. How scary was life for my little self that was so powerfuless and had no one to protect myself. So the way I learned to receive any attention and ""love"" was to sexualize myself. I was hypersexual but also dissociating as a toddler. I think the predators especially saw me as an easy target because they thought i was slow due to dissociation and couldn't do anything.  Everything is making sense.. it makes sense that I am in my late 20's and fear sex, have a history of being attracted to predators and sexually aroused by violating sex (trauma reenactment), have chronic yeast and digestive issues since a child, dissociation, feared men, protective of my little sister, experienced flashbacks and discomfort around children, why I was so hypersexual, and why I feel vaginal pain (flashbacks??) randomly.  I've lived most of my life in denial and not knowing the full extent of what happened to me. I was able to get my education and fulfil some major goals but something was always broken and off. People frequently told me I was weird and crazy. Now things are making sense.  I feel so broken now that I have a strong glimpse of my horrible childhood. I don't know how I can ever feel real joy and happiness now that I know  what happened to me as a little baby and girl. Of course I wish it never happened but I wish I was older. I was too little, too innocent.. how could anyone do this?  Any support and validation would be appreciated, thank you"
journey1992,11,"Has anyone been able to reverse their attraction to trauma arousal (being turned on by events and people similar to their sexual abuse) and develop a healthy sexuality?  I know it can be done but id like to hear if anything has been able to or knows someone who has? I have been struggling with so much shame and resentment with myself for only really being able to get turned on by predatory people and videos/fantasies similar to my sexual abuse. I recently had a repressed memory come out of being sexually abused as a baby/toddler which makes me so sick. Now I know the root cause of why I was so dissociative, hypersexual, flirty, seeked out predators/sexual violence and have always feared and was grossed out by sex. Id rather continue repressing my sexuality than get turned on by violating sex similar to my abuse. I wonder if I will ever enjoy sex and become turned on my healthy people and sex? I wonder how I can fully embrace my sexuality again now that I know my full history? I feel disgusting being sexual now that I know that first sexual experiences were rape as a child.  Who else relates? Who has been able to reverse the trauma arousal and has a healthy sexuality? How?"
journey1992,11," I feel awful and rejected... my new therapist referred me out because they couldn't handle me  I was really excited to start equine therapy with a therapist that shares the same cultural background as me and where we would work with animals and nature. It seemed too good to be true.. and then I got an email saying my needs were greater than what she was qualified to work with.I am glad she was honest especially before i developed a relationship, but I am disappointed...What sucks is she knew before she met me I had cptsd which she said she could help with. I guess when she finally met with me, she realized how extensive my trauma history was and maybe it overwhelmed her. It sucks because I spilled my guts about my life and who I am and now it feels like she is rejecting me after I became vulnerable. I feel bad and unlovable.   I haven't had a therapist for over half a year since I reported my old therapist for abuse. The little girl in me feels rejected like when people growing up would always say I was too crazy or weird to be around. The little girl in me is sad because relationships often go wrong for me. I want things to go right and be easy...  Ahhh, it is really hitting me with the reality that I really have gone through a lot.. more so than a lot of people (childhood sexual, emotional and physical abuse, etc for most of my life ). Things were bad for too long, I am realizing as I continue to process my trauma and Face reality.  Who else has been referred out because a therapist could not handle you? Any validation and support would be nice, thanks."

journey1992,11,"I've officially gone completely no contact... it was so hard not wishing my little sister a happy birthday yesterday  My head hurts, it feels like it is going to explode.  I feel dirty and guilty as I detox. But I know it was the right decision to cut off my siblings. They chose  complicity and to support my abusive parents. They chose their own convenience and comfort, well now I have to choose mine.  It was really hard not saying happy birthday to my little sister yesterday. I have always thought the world of my sister who is 6 years younger than me (she is in her early 20's now). I protected and nurtured her as best as I could growing up. No, our relationship was not perfect as there was also abuse between us especially from me being older because we were pitted against each other from our pedophilic father who groomed both of us but sexually abused me.   Due to guilt for being abusive towards her and probably traumatizing my sister growing up, I excused my sister's scapegoating and her misplaced anger towards me instead of the real abusers. I thought I deserved it. I apologized to her about it a year ago and have changed. Not excusing my abuse, but it is time to let go of that guilt as I was doing what I needed to survive and did the best as I could as I was younger to love my sister.   But she is not a little girl anymore, and her behavior is toxic and getting in the way of my healing. She has acknowledged the abuse our parents did but she still treats me as the scapegoat. She did not help or support me when I had to temporarily move in with them then had to escape. Instead she supported my parents and put her anger on me even after she acknowledged the abuse had happened. It was heartbreaking to see she wasn't the little angelic sister I thought I knew. She was selfish and did not care or value me like I felt towards her. She cried and felt bad for my parents when I went no contact.  Where was the integrity?  I get it, she is probably struggling to accept my parents for who they are and there is some Denial about our family trauma. But I am not going to wait for her to come around and be her punching bag. In fact, even if she does eventually come around, I don't think I will let her back in. I will have moved on. She was not there for me during the hardest time of my life but instead chose to blame me. I am even realizing throughout our childhood she did scapegoat me for the most part such as calling the police on me when my sociopathic mom and I fought. She supported and helped me here and there but mostly saw me as the bad one.  I was limited contact with my siblings for a year but now I am doing the real thing. Here comes the grieving. She is not the little girl I need to protect anymore, I have to protect myself from her now and let her go.  Any support and validation would be nice, thanks. Who else felt you deserved abuse from a sibling due to guilt of childhood abuse?"
journey1992,11,"Who else was the scapegoat and struggles with oversharing? Why do you overshare?  Scapegoat over here who overshares. I think the reasons I did it was boundaries were a mess in my dysfunctional family and I wanted intimacy so badly I would rush relationships. But also because I always felt I had to prove I was being honest and not bad since I was the scapegoat. I always felt like I had to explain myself because people weren't going to trust me and I was the bad one. I also was in denial about my trauma history a bit as I didn't want to accept people can be evil so I was giving people the benefit of the doubt. Total gaslighting because what ended up happening is the other person was not as open as me so I ended up being exploited/manipulated and what I said was used against me. People often tell me they like how honest and genuine I am but I've realized I need to start listening to my gut and close my mouth when it does not feel safe for me to share especially when I barely know the person. I am not ashamed of my story and eventually may make talks and write books on my life but as for now, I need to be careful about sharing so much so I am not a target for abusers and I don't scare away healthy people.  Who else overshares and why? How are you stopping yourself?"
journey1992,11,"Any other scapegoats internalize  feeling like a bad person and get paranoid others will think you are even though you're not? How are you detoxing that internalized belief?  My sociopathic mother projected their evilness onto me. They called me evil and a bad apple. They turned the whole family against me and I was heavily scapegoated. I now see that they were the evil one and were jealous and hated me especially because of dad was abusing me.  So throughout my life, I felt like a bad person and when I was young it became a self fulfilling prophecy since sometimes kids do make mistakes which my mom loved because then she would have proof: ""see? she is bad!""I learned to stop caring to a degree what others thought of me because they were going to hate and find reasons not to like me anyways. For the most part, I walked to the beat of my own drum and developed strong integrity and values at a young age.   So now I am in my late 20's and have really worked on developing my sense of self and boundaries. I now know I was never evil and am actually very empathic and what one may call an empath. So while I know this about myself and know I always try to do the right thing and when I don't I hold myself accountable and change.. I still don't trust that others see this in me and am suspicious they will assume I will do bad things. I still haven't detoxified myself from the bad message. I have had experiences with a couple bad therapists who acted like I was bad and judged me after I was open to them about my past and fighting with my sociopathic mom (one told me that they thought i was a borderline and there was no cure and was hopeless. they then acted scared of me. wtf!).  So a lot of my healing work over the years has been self isolating myself from people as a way of setting a boundary from others' assumptions of me. This way I could figure out who I was instead of sucking up others' thoughts which is easy to do as an empath.   When something bad happens, I often assume someone will think I did it like my sociopathic mom and brother used to do. In the past, I sometimes would say bad things about myself so others would think poorly of me because it was normal and familiar for people to see me as bad I thought.. and it made me feel in control if I made them not like me right away instead of being hurt when they rejected me later on. I basically was setting up scenarios over and over again where I would be scapegoated.   I would also overshare and feel like I had to prove I was honest and a good person to others.. which of course made people suspicious. I have internalized self blame for things that were not my fault such as sexual abuse. Also, I am a mixed black woman, so I have been negatively stereotyped at times and have had to learn how to detoxify from society's messages as well.  Who else struggles with worrying that others will think you are bad and how are you getting rid of that toxic message?"
journey1992,11,Who else shames themselves for taking so long to move on from a traumatic situation?  It is going to be one year next month since I experienced a very traumatic sexual harassment experience. I still think about what happened everyday. It makes me feel ashamed that I'm still stuck ruminating about it. I want to move on but it's like my body is physically addicted to replaying what happened like I literally get aroused then ashamed which is so confusing but i know this is not uncommon for sexual violence victims.  I feel guilty and like It is my fault  for not moving on even though I know this is part of post-traumatic stress disorder where we tend to replay trauma to process.   Who else struggles with this and shames themselves?
journey1992,11,"Who else struggles with romanticizing your abuse?   ""I was the soft, innocent, pretty, sweet feminine and he couldn't help himself and was so rough and forceful... And he took advantage of me.. I tried to save him, he has a bad childhood and was sweet on the inside""  Sounds like the books I used to read when I was young. Society also Sometimes romanticizes abuse, check out Lana Del Rey's music. Rape culture is also so prevalent where forcing women to like you or have sex is normal. Sometimes I romanticize the abuse I went through, it makes me feel unique and special for be chosen to be abused. Like I was an actress in a movie.  It is messed up because I'm sure it makes it harder for people to leave abusive relationships when they see it in this light. I also know it is a way to cope with abuse so it doesn't feel as bad. Who else struggles with this sometimes and how do you move through it?"
journey1992,11,"(I wrote an unsent letter to my ex-therapist, support and validation would be wonderful, thanks!)  A letter to my ex-abusive therapist:  You were so awful, insecure, manipulative and abusive. You are almost a decade older than me and a therapist.. and still doing this? Do better.  You were confused about who you were, your feelings for me, and what you wanted out of our ""therapeutic relationship."" You projected your own issues on me like it was your second job. You think everyone owes you something because of what you've been through. It is not all about you. Get yourself out of the game because you are doing more harm.   You are so annoying, trying to have power over me with your gross judgmental ego, you pissy B. Thank God I left. Of course I wish it was sooner but half a year isn't long compared to the length of my other old abusive relationships.   You stopped caring about me as a client. Actually, I don't think you ever cared. I can't imagine how you would be as a partner. I am questioning if I am even queer now because you manipulated me into feeling like I was in love but that ain't love. I didn't love you, you didn't even care about me. Now I know what love is and is not. Control, sadism, push-pulling, and gaslighting is not love. It just shows how insecure you are. You wanted me to stay dependent on you without getting my needs met. You tried to get me to stay even though you knew it wasn't in my best interest. You betrayed me by hiding your romantic feelings and intentions and then gaslighting me when I suspected. You used my past trauma to hurt me and bring down my self esteem.   I will never let anyone dim my light again. I will run away quicker, I will shine brightly and never allow parasites to bring me down because they want the light all to themselves and are insecure. This is how I know I made progress, I'm not even attracted to those insecure light dimmers anymore---it reeks of insecurity. I love a confident and assertive person. I'm leaving these relationships quicker and not going back. You were just like my dad but it took me 27 years to leave him... This time, though, I caught on quicker, stood up to you, and trusted my intuition and left. It feels so good to write this and I don't feel the need to protect your feelings anymore. I get to focus and care about my needs and feelings. I love and respect myself, I choose me. I feel free."
journey1992,11,"  Who else has noticed more creeps/predators preying on your vulnerabilities due to trauma?  Before I processed my trauma and realized I had PTSD, I would always put on a fake face and be really confident, positive and social around others in college (I was in my higher self a lot). I remember feeling like a lot of men respected me and it scared away many creeps and predators looking for an easier target. I mean yes, I still experienced creepiness but I also felt many were scared away because I was popular.   But after college, then i started facing the reality of my trauma and now 8 years later, I am allowing myself to ""go crazy."" Like I am not being fake with anyone. I allow myself to feel my different emotions in public, like being sad or angry at work. I've told people I have PTSD. I avoid people, eye contact, self isolating,  am not as confident and secure. One thing I have especially been noticing is I have been being creeped on more and I think it is because these predators can sense my vulnerabilities now more. They choose me because I am an easy target where they can get away with abusing me because no one will believe me since they think I am crazy.  I was harassed at a support group several months ago and I can't stop thinking about what happened. I was stuck in a room with men  who sexualized me by getting boners, stared, leered at my legs and butt, then one stared at my legs, ran out of the room then creepily waiting for me while I was alone to walk me to my car and ask where I lived. At parties, men would touch my body at parties because they couldn't ""help it."" The last two times I was in the ER, the health care providers unnecessarily flicked my breasts while they put a strap on my arms for an EKG. The doctor sexually looked my body and legs. A male nurse leered at my body as I walked to and from the bathroom. While I was in school internships, I was sexually harassed by two leaders. One stalked me, leered at me, controlled me, intimidated me, wouldn't take no for an answer, and was angry whenever I spoke to men. The other one followed me around, became aroused around me, and told me I remind him of his wife and if he had another son, he would have him marry me. This creepiness from men has been happening all my life starting with my dad and I am tired of it. I don't even do my hair anymore, lost weight, wear baggy clothes and avoid men so I can avoid potential sexualization and creeps.   I spend most of my days dissociating and replaying traumatic memories. It has taken over my life.  I feel so stuck and I am struggling to get out. I also think because I am so stuck in my trauma, my vibration is low and my victim mentality is attracting these predators.  Who else relates and has noticed more creeps have been coming out due to your vulnerabilities related to trauma?"
journey1992,11,"Did I get sexually harassed in ER?  I have been to the ER twice recently for difficulty breathing. The first time, the doctor looked at my body sexually. But what was weird and I am not sure is normal, but when the EKG guy put an arm cuff (maybe for blood pressure) on my upper arm, my breast was flicked aggressively. I was laying down and I felt him flick/push my boob twice either with the back of his hand (I was looking the other way while the nurse gave me a shot so I couldn't see exactly what happened). It is not like my boobs are so huge that got in the way (34 C) so I don't know if it is normal for people to get their breasts flicked while getting the cuff put on while laying down or maybe I was being touched unnecessarily. I definitely picked up creepy vibes from him, so much so that I asked for a female EKG to put the stickers on me. Then a second time in the ER, a male nurse followed me to and from the bathroom to stare at my butt when I turned around abruptly to show I knew what he was doing, he made a startled sound like he was caught red handed.  Then my breast was flicked again by another EKG worker while putting on an arm cuff.   Has this breast flicking ever happened to anyone? I think I was sexually harassed but I am not certain and it bothers me.. my intuition says I was."

journey1992,11,"I’m Scared... no one can tell me it’s gonna be okay, because no one knows it will be. #covid19  Usually I am the one always freaking out with my cPTSD and someone will tell me everything will be okay, I’m being triggered... but now everyone else is hyper vigilant, self isolating, anxious and none of us know if we will be okay and it’s so scary. It is so scary. My therapist couldn’t have our session today because they needed to self care and figure out what they can really handle with this pandemic and therapy sessions. I don’t know if they will be taking a break from giving sessions or what. I’m scared of losing the only support I’ve got.    Who feels the same?"
journey1992,11,.
journey1992,11,"I screwed up, I called and told my therapist  I was in love with them...  I screwed up and am feeling shame right now. I’m afraid to post right now because I am afraid of people being disappointed and judging me. I posted about having feelings for my therapist last week and a lot of you were so supportive. Quick recap: last week, I told my therapist I was attracted to them, they told me they were not attracted to me, and then we talked about how it is probably transference where they remind me of my sexually abusive father.   Yesterday was my birthday and I drank a lot of Kombucha and got tipsy/drunk. I spoke to a phone warm line therapist talking to her about how I think I am in love with my therapist and I think it is more than transference. I also told them this is such a unique feeling because I haven’t allowed myself to  like someone in such a long and also this is the first time I realized that I am queer (my therapist is transmasculine and I am a woman).   This phone therapist encouraged me to call my therapist (wtf!!! Of course I take responsibility for my actions but what Horrible advice looking back!). So I call my therapist at like 10 pm and tell them I love them, admire them and respect them so much. My therapist asked if I was on drugs  and I told them no, that I was probably tipsy from kombucha. They say this is inappropriate and we will talk during our next session.   Today I am feeling shame and so much fear!!! I am shaking right now. I am scared I self sabotaged. And they may have to abandon me and refer me to another therapist. There is also a part of me that feels more alive for going after what I want and expressing my feelings for once... it has been such a long time since I have gone after what I wanted and allowed myself to feel love for someone else.. even though this is sooo inappropriate since they are my therapist.  I texted my therapist an apology for violating their boundaries and being inappropriate. I told them I accept any consequences for my actions.   Omg... I haven’t done anything so crazy like this in a long time (since college 7 years ago when I used to get drunk a lot)....  I also am trying not to shame myself .....   Any support Would be appreciated. Sorry for disappointing you all if I did. I screwed up. This amazing therapist was going to help me heal my cPTSD and they were the best one I’ve ever had... and now I may have halted my progress (for now) because of this. I’m a mess.  I worry my therapist will end therapy with me because they don’t seem to be comfortable or have much experience working with erotic transference. When I first told them about my attraction, they said they had to set a boundary about not letting me talk about their attraction to them and only talk about the attachment piece. Then last week, I told them I read it would be very beneficial for me to discuss the erotic transference. First they were said they would have to think about it but then I convinced them to talk about the erotic transference... which ended up being a beneficial session as we uncovered more trauma core beliefs. So there is this worry I have that my therapist cannot handle this."
journey1992,11,"I am now feeling really hurt and triggered by my therapist saying they are not sexually attracted to me at all...  Due to child sexual abuse, I was groomed into thinking the only way I received love was by me sexualizing myself and performing/ charming others. I could make many people like me even if they weren’t initially attracted to me. I was quick to change myself into their dream girl. I was super sexual. When I couldn’t charm and seduce someone or if they did not find me attractive, it really hurt... because remember I based my worth and my ability to be loved by being able to seduce. That was the only way I received love and care from my father and other abusers. I struggled to commit to others (disorganized attachment) but felt pride with my ability to easily seduce others.  I have to retrain my brain into really believing others can care and love me without being sexually attracted to me. Unfortunately, I did not realize that lesson due to my father only caring about me because I was fulfilling his need.   Recently, I told my therapist I was attracted to them and they said they were not sexually attracted to me at all. It hurt. I told them I was mad at them, wanted to know why they did not like me, and I felt like I could make them like me by changing myself. They set a boundary and did not answer. Even though this hurt so badly, I think it was important because it is showing me they can care about me without being attracted. But I still think the way they said it was insensitive. If they were attracted to me, would it have been different? When I confronted my dad about the covert sexual abuse, he denied it by saying he was not attracted to me and I was not his type. So basically he would have been sexual with me if he was my type, according to his logic.. even though he was lying as he already had been sexually abusive. So my therapist saying that is very triggering. Why couldn’t they have just said: I would not cross that boundary because I am not able to see you in that light because I am your therapist? Two weeks before, I had told my therapist  that I worried they would sexualize me (understandable due to my trauma history!!) and they defensively said they were not sexually attracted to me at all and it would be unethical for them If they were. They seemed irritated and mad. I wonder if they became so defensive because they are queer/transmasculine and in the past may have had people stereotype that they sexualizing others because they are queer. Just like when I told them I felt triggering around the sometimes due to their presenting masculinity— they did not validate my concern but instead said they wondered if I was uncomfortable with my own masculinity therefore projecting onto them. I later confronted them about it and they apologized and said they understood why I would be triggered by masculinity and are still working out their masculinity stuff.   I now feel really ugly and disgusting. I’ve been looking in the mirror and seeing that I really am not attractive at all. I’m skinny, thinning hair, bad skin... I’m not attractive like I used to be. It really hurts how insensitive my therapist was. I feel like they said it that way to crush my self esteem. They were dismissive, cruel, and insensitive. Just like my dad was."
journey1992,11,"My therapist told me they are not attracted to me: I feel rejected but also hopeful   I told my therapist I was experiencing erotic transference and was attracted to them again today. They said they feel really clear about not being attracted to me and how they never would cross that boundary because it is not ethical. They told me they still care about me even though they are not attracted to me. We talked about how because of my Child sexual abuse history, i always associated caring/love with sexuality.. so it feels like they are taking away love for not being sexually interested. We talked about how there is transference going on where I am idealizing them because they represent what I needed and never got from a caregiver. I told them there is a part of me that feels I can make them like me and I wanted to know why they weren’t attracted to me. They said they were going to set a boundary there and not answer those questions.  I told them I felt mad at them and rejected for saying that they were not attracted to me. I told them it made me feel like I was unattractive since I have based my worth on others’ opinions and validation. I asked them if they felt disgusted with me for liking them. They said no, they were not disgusted. They said they understood where the disgust was coming from.. it may be because I am feeling disgust thinking about how my dad crossed inappropriate sexual boundaries and also because I am being queer for being attracted to my therapist (I am a woman and they are transmasculine/queer).  I told them I feel hopeful and safer now that I know they would not cross that boundary/are not even attracted to me. This is important work and breakthrough! Someone is caring about me without wanting a sexual incentive!! I still have hurt feelings and ego though, for them not being attracted to me.  Do you all think they could have said they were not attracted to me in a gentler way?  This is a good session, though.. I’d say. Support would be appreciated! Thank you :)"

journey1992,11," It is hard for me to blame and hold accountable “nice” abusers who tried hard not to sexualize me but “couldn’t help themselves.”  I was at an addiction meeting and I was passionately agreeing saying “mmhmm” a lot and one man got a boner. He looked like he didn’t want that to happen and was embarrassed. Then when we were leaving the meeting, his hands were shaking as he ran to the door, it looked like he was trying not to look at me. Then he opened the door for me and I turned around and saw he was staring at my butt. This man is the same age as my sexually abuse father who did the same thing so very triggering   There was another man who harassed me at the meeting—- he was entitled, quick to anger, unapologetically stared at my legs, watched me while I was alone and waited to walk me to my car and asked where I lived. Compared to this guy, The first guy seems so much better. So I struggled with really allowing myself to be angry with him and blaming him. I actually felt like protecting him because he seemed so friendly and innocent (just like I did with my sexually abusive father) and like he was trying not to sexualize me. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt so badly just like I wanted to give my dad. I felt some guilt when I reported the first man because he really seemed like he was trying really hard not to sexualize me and I even omitted the fact that he got a boner during the meeting in the report.  I realize this man was still to blame, though.. even though I don’t fully believe it. At the end of the day, even if it wasn’t his intention, the impact was the same.. I felt violated, betrayed and sexualized. Sexual harassment is harassment no matter what the intention was.  However, I really struggle with being as angry at these kinds of men “nice”, soft, seemingly innocent me who “try” not to sexualize.. but “couldn’t help it.” It is messed up how women are trained in society to baby men as if they can’t learn self control.  Who else relates?"
journey1992,11,"Who else felt it was your fault you were sexualized because of your bubbly/friendly personality and poor boundaries?  I’m really struggling with this. Some background: I have been sexualized by my abusers since I was a child and so I had patterns of flirting without realizing it.  Then I think men felt led on and would sexualize me. Of course this pattern is not my fault as it came from being groomed as a child as sexualizing myself was the main way I received love and attention. I’ve worked really hard over the last several years to break this pattern..  A traumatic event happened recently were some men sexualized me and one preyed on me. There is definitely a part of me that has felt like it was my fault.. I wondered if by mistake I was being too bubbly and passionate and they took it as me flirting and got the wrong idea.   Throughout my life, I’ve realized men would sometimes get the wrong idea with my bubbly/friendly personality and the fact that I had poor boundaries... so I learned how to change my personality and become more masculine because I felt like I had to do that to stop the sexualization and abuse. Obviously it shouldn’t be my job to control their feelings and actions (codependent much?!). Instead they should be controlling themselves. But I still struggle with this belief that I’ve internalized where I have to change myself to stop their behavior. After facing my trauma history over the last several years, I now dress super conservative, stopped wearing makeup, stopped doing my hair, lost my curves, worked on boundaries and act cold around men. I think working on boundaries is important but I don’t like how I felt I had to change my personality. Also, the sad thing is, I dressed super conservative with baggy clothes and I was still sexualized at a recovery group I went to recently.  There really is no protection.   Who else related to blaming yourself?"
journey1992,11,"Anyone else invalidate your trauma because of societal privileges you have? (Race, color, class, education, etc.)  I really struggle with invalidating my trauma because of privileges I have due to my education level, growing up middle class, in the safe suburbs, and my racial mixture.  I’ve had people who didn’t have my privileges invalidate my trauma and pain because of my privileges.   I’ve internalized this invalidation because there have been many times I’d do the same to people who were more privileged as me... which is not okay, of course.  My therapist thinks one reason I invalidate my trauma is a form of avoidance so I don’t have to process and face the pain of my trauma and how bad it was.   The truth is, I can have certain privileges and still have a really rough life due to trauma. Yes, it might have been worse if I was really poor, a different racial background and wasn’t able to get an education... but the trauma was still really bad. Also, everyone is different and has different unique resiliency and resources so what is ok for someone may have been debilitating to someone else.   I had relatives who abused me because they saw me as privileged due to my racial mixture and class. They saw me as spoiled because my dad gave me everything. What they didn’t know (and I didn’t realize until recently) was I was being sexualized and groomed by my father. His spoiling was part of grooming and an exchange for covert sexual abuse. When I wasn’t at his beck and call, he would take away these resources/spoiling. I think To some people growing up , I came across as stuckup and high maintenance due to my past spoiling but it was at such a high cost. I was sexually abused, verbally abused, financially abused, scapegoated, and controlled by him. Yes, our family was well off.. but money is obviously not everything and sure as heck does not bring happiness."
journey1992,11,"Success: I reported predators of an organization and they were forced to go through training to stop their behavior!  I went to an addiction support group where I unfortunately experienced some sexualization and racism by three men who leered at my body parts. When I first arrived, two of the men made passive racist comments about my race. One married man lustfully stared at me and got mad/sad when I set a boundary. One man got a boner in the middle of the meeting as I was passionately talking and later ran to the door with his hands shaking, held the door and stared at my butt. One man with an anger and control problem was rude to me during the meeting.. but when we stood up to leave, he leered at my legs and ran out the door. I decided to not go down the elevator with the men because I didn’t feel safe but that same man waited behind, watching me in the corner while I walked to the elevator and was alone. He then asked where I lived. This was in the evening, too! This was creepy and inappropriate especially at a support group when I had already shared vulnerable information such as my cPTSD diagnosis. I felt traumatized and triggered by the event.   I stopped going to the organization but several months later, I decided to report the harassment to the organization. This is the first time I received such a positive and supportive response after reporting harassment and abuse! The female leaders of the organization apologized for my experienced, offered help and took my suggestion to have the male leaders to undergo training to correct their behavior! They had to go through implicit bias and trauma informed training so they correct their behavior. I don’t know if the men feel bad but they are going to have to change their behavior now if they want to keep their positions. I’m sure they also felt embarrassment for getting called out.   I am proud of myself and feel like a badass feminist in the making! I love that I didn’t take their shit like I have in the past with other men! Those men reminded me of my past abusers, so to stand up.. I feel like I am standing up for my younger selves that did not! I am continuing the journey more and more of really standing up to racism/sexism, holding these creeps accountable and not blaming myself so much that I don’t report.  These men were predatory leaders preying on women at an addiction recovery group and this behavior needs to stop!"
journey1992,11,"Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you?  I thought the way men showed they liked me was when they leered and sexualized me. I was groomed due to child sexual abuse and our sexist society... I thought this behavior was normal. I was flattered, turned on (traumatic bonding and brain changes), and was attracted to creeps. It didn’t feel like love or like a guy liked me enough if they didn’t sexualize me.  Now as I have been processing my past trauma, I realize how much I hate and fear being sexualized. I don’t want to be sexualized at all and get grossed out when men do. I don’t want to do anything sexual or even date for that matter. I now see how wrong it is for men to minimize me to a sexual body!  I was so offended recently when I went to an educational discussion and at the end of the meeting the men were leering at my body.. how horrible that sex was the only thing that was on their mind instead of my intellect and what I could bring to help them!!!  So this is progress for me to realize how wrong sexism is because in the past, I never saw myself as a feminist. I still struggle with my body being turned on by creepiness because it was what was “normal” for so long. I am actually afraid of my sexuality right now and feel shame and disgust about it especially when I become turned on by violating sex.   However, I’m also noticing When I watch movies or see pictures of women getting sexualized, I get grossed out and triggered More than I ever have. I am now allowing myself to get grossed out by the creepers and being mean to them when I wasn’t able to for most of my life. I still have a part of me that gets turned on by creepiness and sexualization but I can confidently say it is starting to fade away especially as I continue processing my trauma and become more of a feminist. I was brainwashed by society and the abusers in my life. It is so bizarre to now see the truth and how what I was told was a lie about the sexualization and abuse of women to be normal and flattering.   I know with time and therapy, I will be able to retrain my brain to be turned on by healthy sex with consent and boundaries completely. I am already noticing that I am being drawn to these types of healthy relationships which I am very proud of myself for.   Who else relate?"
journey1992,11,"I feel so betrayed by my sexual harassers but also guilty for reporting them: maybe it wasn’t their intention to be creepy and don’t men frequently sexualize women they like?  I went to an addiction support group where I unfortunately experienced some sexualization by three men who leered at my body parts. One married man lustfully stared at me and got mad/sad when I set a boundary. One man got a boner in the middle of the meeting  (I could tell he was embarrassed about it) as I was passionately talking and later held the door and stared at my butt (I could tell he was trying not to). One man stared unapologetically at my legs, then waited for me while I was alone, and then asked where I lived. This was creepy and inappropriate especially at a support group when I had already shared vulnerable information such as my cPTSD diagnosis. I felt traumatized and triggered by the event. It is bringing up past trauma from my past where I normalized men sexualizing me because I thought it was how men first showed they liked you. I am depressed and what really sucks is I wanted to be part of that organization the support group was a part of so badly and now I haven’t been back since. Last night I had a dream I went to one of the events of the organization and one of the men who harassed me was nice and I felt safe...  I want to give those men the benefit of the doubt... I don’t want to fully accept they were predatory and creepy and just had sex on their mind after our meeting. I realize the man who got a boner and stared at my butt has especially triggered me. He reminds me of my dad—-similar age and looks similarly to my dad. Just like my dad, I felt safe around him but then he ended up sexualizing me. I wonder: how long was he thinking about sex with me? I trusted him to keep me safe, he did the opposite. I didn’t even realize.... just like my dad, I didn’t figure out he was covertly sexually abusing me until way later. Also did they really like me for me or preying on my vulnerability?  I am also feeling guilt about reporting them (Logically, I know I shouldn’t!!). I think those guys may have had a crush on me.. and don’t men think about sex more often? Don’t men sexualize women more often? Plus they are former addicts, their impulse control may not be so good?  I also wonder.. do they feel bad? Or are they mad I told on them and got caught? The man who was my dad’s age seemed to have empathy so I bet he feels bad. The two other men hinted they didn’t have empathy so I bet they are mad. Have they just moved on and are enjoying their lives while I suffer?  Ugh, I’m struggling.. and support and advice would be helpful. Anyone else have felt this way after reporting their abusers/harassers?"

Often I’ll purposely ruminate about my trauma and trigger myself because I don’t want to sit with my feelings like self-loathing and fear. I keep trying to push myself to do more (make friends, go to events, date, etc.) but I think part of the healing process is just allowing myself to be, do nothing and feel which is what I am so afraid of. Healing takes time and I just want to rush through it.. I’ve been making myself watch movies and documentaries similar to my trauma history but I think it has been too much because I’ve been dissociating recently. Now I am waiting to hear back from someone so I can do psychedelics therapy in the future which will probably help speed the healing journey... I want to be better already but I am doing things that are probably making it worse ruminating and rushing.   I am learning how to embrace how broken and unstable I really am. Instead of pushing myself to get back into social work to help others and make more money.. I am now coming to the realization how broken I am and how I really can’t be trying to save others..

I’m feeling annoyed with myself because I feel like in some ways I have a victim mentality where I am self-sabotaging by isolating myself and dwelling on my problems and not really living. I feel stuck. I also get that I should stop being hard on myself because my cPTSD is 99.999% the reason for being alone a lot and not feeling safe around others or at events.  I’m feeling so bored and often my ptsd intrusive thoughts and flashbacks are what keep me entertained.   I think I need to start pushing myself to get out there I mean there are some safe spaces I can go to where I can interact with others... but I think my depression makes it hard to want to hang out with people a lot and I am so sensitive to triggers and rejection. I want to live and have fun again but now that I’m aware of my trauma, I don’t want to go out to parties because I now hate being sexualized. I also feel this pressure to start dating and have sex but really I don’t want to have sex and don’t trust men right now. I don’t do my hair anymore or put effort in the way I look.   Sometimes I feel like I’m looking for problems where I make problems and to bigger things because of my boredom but I also know it’s related to hypervigilance and being triggered. I also am so used to the drama of abusive relationship and I think I get bored and self sabatoging to keep drama to a certain point.   As I keep processing more of my trauma history..

journey1992,11,"My therapist is becoming more masculine and it is triggering and making me feel less safe   I don’t feel safe around men and I definitely did not want a male therapist. When I first met my therapist, they identified as she/her/hers and presented more feminine as they wore their hair long. I also felt like their personality was more bubbly and feminine when I met them or maybe because they presented more feminine I felt that way?   Now they identify as they/they, act less bubbly/warm and more masculine, wear their hair short and dress more masculine. They do not identify as a man so they are not trans but I think they are queer and non-binary. I am noticing I am becoming triggered by my therapist. I do not feel safe around masculinity, male presenting people, and/or people who may be attracted to me. When they act more masculine, I get triggered especially now because I feel they are dressing more masculine.   This sucks. My therapist is so great and has been helpful so far (the past 6 months).. but now I am questioning if we are the right fit. I was looking for a nurturing feminine motherly presence to help me heal my CPTSD.  I feel bad about offending them, I told them it felt uncomfortable to bring this up because I did not want to offend them since it was about their identity. They told me they wonder if my discomfort around them has to do with me not being comfortable with my own repressed masculine energy as they think my authentic self has some masculine strong qualities to it. That made me wonder a bit if that was going on... plus also because I am questioning my sexuality—wondering if I am bisexual. But I still don’t really think that is it..... I really think they are triggering me because of their male presentation and masculinity. A couple weeks ago, I felt like they were mad/irritated with me so I did what I normally do to other men: flirt with them because I feared their anger!!! Also sometimes I get confused because I feel I am attracted to them because they are presenting more masculine a-times. I also have worried about them sexualizing me as I know they are also into women in the past. Not so much now but definitely in the beginning.  I did tell them how I felt. They said they have more masculine energy but they also have feminine energy.. they said they understand I want a mom but they can offer me both a mom (feminine energy) and dad (masculine energy) depending on their energy in the moment.    Anyone else struggle with this? I am wondering if I should stay as we are so compatible in other ways and also because it may be healing to have someone with masculine energy treat me well?? Plus they are helping me become more feministic and breaking free from socialization. What do you think about them turning it back on me by saying I could be reacting towards them due to my own repressed masculinity? Should I try to find a feminine and motherly therapist?  I am also worried because I tend to do this pattern of finding flaws in my relationships/therapists as we get closer because of my fear of intimacy and distance (reactive/disorganized attachment) so I hope that is not what is going on here.. recently I’ve been wondering if they really care about me."

I thought father loved me, but no that wasn’t love. He would discard and abuse me once he found another source to covertly sexual abuse. What a lie. I thought I was loved. He used me. Mother never loved me, she was out to get me because she was jealous of my dad preying on me. As a child while he groomed me, she used to say, “you two [father and you] should get married..” she also encouraged his disgusting behavior by saying, “come look at your daughter’s boobs.. they are so big.” I am so sad. I want a mommy. A real one who protects, nurtures, and nourishes me. I am so alone with no one to love me. Sadly, I don’t even feel worthy of it."
journey1992,11,"Anyone else feel like you don’t deserve to report creepers/stalkers due to your own mentally ill/hyper-sexual/creepy past?

I was traumatized from the experience and reported it but have been wondering if it was a mistake to report.. wondering if I brought it on myself on an unconscious level even though it was not my intention. I am still working on my social skills from trauma from childhood (cPTSD) and I think when the men first met me, they thought I was creepy myself for not following social etiquette as I was super anxious and was self hugging and doing/saying awkward things. I Also Was being very passionate about what we were discussing and maybe my “mmhmm” and “mmm” when agreeing, sounded like sex noises/moaning which prompted them to get into a sexual mindset. I mean maybe the men felt like I was leading them on and flirting so is it really their faults??   Due to my child sexual abuse history, I often felt I had to interact with men by sexualizing myself when I was younger in order to be liked and cared for. I stopped doing this behavior once I went through therapy almost 3 years ago now. But I worry that I was doing the same thing on accident sometimes to a certain degree and caused some of their behaviors? One of the men was scaring me and I was probably fawning and he got the wrong idea.  Also due to my past of being obsessive and inappropriate publicly with men (not anymore though), it feels weird that I am now reporting men who had similar hyper sexual behavior I exhibited. I feel bad knowing that they are going to get in trouble a bit and I worry they are going to think I am the crazy one. I can still have compassion for them and hold them accountable.   I am trying to hold the fact that just because I have been creepy/hyper sexual/mentally ill in my past (due to copying my creepy sexual abusers through trauma re-enactment), does not mean it is OK for men to sexually harass and abuse me. And it was their choice to sexually harass me even if they felt led on (even though it was not my intention at all—I was not interested any of the men).  Anyone else relate?

I am afraid of retaliation like one of the members finding me out of anger (one of the men had serious rage issues). I am afraid the men will act like how my father was when I confronted him for his sexual abuse; like lie to the organizers, say they weren’t even attracted to me, say they don’t remember, and make me out to be the crazy one due to my ptsd. I am afraid the organizers who I reported to will not think what happened to me is a big deal and may victim blame. Although when I recently spoke to one of the female leaders, she was very supportive. I keep gaslighting myself, asking, “is what they did really a big deal?” Of course it is, though. I am hearing voices from my past where people victim blamed me saying I was conceited for thinking men were interested and I was just being dramatic. I’ve been feeling like I am betraying the men and bad if they lose their positions. Of course I shouldn’t feel bad. It is their actions not mine that would cause that to happen. How messed up is it as women we are conditioned to protect men and abusers?!  I’ve been feeling so stressed and having panic attacks thinking I am going to die. I’ve been having intrusive thoughts and memories about my past abuse due to being triggered from PTSD. I’ve been watching videos of women being sexualized and abused like I have been which has made me more anxious (body’s way of working out trauma) which I stopped doing today, thank goodness.  The leaders will not tell me what the men will say or what will happen to their positions. So there will be no closure. This unknown part makes Me feel especially anxious. I am glad I reported, though. These men need to be held accountable and me reporting now is empowering because it is what I wish I would have done with my past abusers.

journey1992,11,"Who else did not like finding out your abuser sexualized/harassed other women because it made you feel not special or as beautiful?  Sexism had me all messed up in the past where I normalized sexual abuse/harassment and considered it flattering because “they found me so attractive they could not resist.” I would feel threatened and less special/unique knowing he was doing it to other women. It made me feel less beautiful knowing another woman were getting attention. How messed up is it that sexism pits women against each other that we may hate other women try to get male’s attention even if abusive? Someone else getting attention doesn’t make us less beautiful or special—especially abusive attention!  I am so different than how I used to be. I welcomed and encouraged (re-enacting past trauma) being sexualized and harassed throughout most of my life. Now this behavior is no longer acceptable. I am acknowledging the fear and disrespect I have felt my whole life when men did it that I ignored due to normalizing it as I was sexually abused since I was a child. I am setting boundaries and reporting men for unacceptable behavior to change the system and hold them accountable.  I am a different woman ever since I called out my father and have gone through intensive therapy to heal. I am proud of my progress. Instead of feeling threatened that my abusers have been abusing other women, I am learning how to have solidarity with other women knowing a lot of us have gone through the same struggles with this sexist society.

journey1992,11,"I (female, late 20’s) have CPTSD so I know intrusive thoughts and memories are totally a PTSD thing. I know by replaying this memories, my mind is trying to process and fix/work out the trauma. I know me being turned on by my sexual abuse and watching it happen to others (on film and porn) is a common traumatic bonding response where our bodies become addicted to the abuse and abuser. My body associates abuse with an arousal response after years of abuse (like the dog experiment someone commented about). Since I was a child, I wanted to be assaulted and taken advantage of. The abuse felt normal, scary but also arousing. It makes sense how I often found myself with the same creepy/poor boundary men who manipulated and abused their power while infantilizing me.   What confuses me and bothers me is when I get turned on when other women experience similar abuse. As a child, I enjoyed watching movies where the women were exploited. I didn’t want to do the exploiting, I wanted it to happen to me and I enjoyed watching it happen to other women. Recently I met someone who reminded me of myself—similar looks and personality (innocent and wholesome).. and I had this intrusive fantasy of kissing her and then I imagined someone taking advantage of her and I felt turned on, guilty, confused, and bad about her being abused in my fantasy all at once. I think one of my parts came out (internal family system) that saw myself in her and projected the abuse on to her. It was like I was taking on/empathizing with my abusers perspective to see why and how they violated me. Sometimes I pick up/copy expressions from others including my abusers without realizing it.. like I’ll start acting like them. I have had these fantasies with other women who reminded me of myself in the past as well—innocent, airhead and helpless women.    There is research about victims sometimes acting their abuse on others. I wouldn’t do that to her, I would not want to exploit her nor would I ever go through with it because I am pretty sure I’m straight (although sometimes bi curious). I felt confusion like.. was I attracted to her or was I just re-enacting my abuse onto her in my fantasy where I became one of my abusers (the men who have exploited me)? Also I have known her as an acquaintance for many years and haven’t ever felt attracted to her in that way... unless maybe I was suppressing my bisexual part?  I felt really bothered by my fantasy/intrusive thoughts  and I wonder if anyone else experienced this? Any feedback and thoughts would be appreciated!"
journey1992,11,"  Anyone else feel special/unique when being abused because it felt like love, attention and flattering that he was so comfortable to express his feelings/disrespect with you?  Yeah, it’s messed up.. traumatic bonding will make you feel special to experience their abuse. I felt flattered that my abusers felt comfortable and safe enough around me to show their true feelings and use me as a punching bag. I felt flattered they “wanted me so badly” that they became jealous and angry with me for talking to other guys and/or setting boundaries. I felt good about being a passive and submissive because it made me feel feminine (I’ve been really insecure about being masculine). I felt like I deserved the abuse. It felt like love. Relationships were not true love if they didn’t put me down, make fun of me, make me feel dumb, belittle me, disrespect or verbally abuse me. I had to protect their fragile egos and “save/fix them”—codependency! Their feelings/needs came first. Then when they would abuse me, I felt sorry for them because I saw their inner child hurting and wanted to take care of them. The abuse aroused me sexually and I became excited (traumatic bonding addiction).  But that wasn’t love. True love is free, uplifting and does not hurt. So sad how we become brainwashed in traumatic abusive relationships."

He smirked at me when I said I wanted to be a model basically showing he did not think I would make it. He would sexualize me (staring at my body and making inappropriate comments) then put me down when I wasn’t hanging around him and was talking to other men: “you need makeup,” “you’re a narcissist,” “you’re a whore.”  Since I was a little girl I told him I wanted to be an actress. He would always discourage me because he said there was no money in acting and I had to use my brain. He made me feel like I couldn’t stand a chance. After graduating from college, I was going to move to LA to pursue acting but he constantly discouraged me and crushed my dreams. With my sister, though, he was different. He didn’t sexualize her, he treated her more how a father should be with a daughter. He encouraged her singing abilities and took her to singing lessons.

Of course I can get back into, nothing is stopping me.. but i keep hearing his voices and discouragement and that performer part of me feels dead.

There has not been a medication approved for the treatment of PTSD since 2001, despite the significant need.

In The UK, many wonder at the highly unrepresentative student demographic for a supposedly impossible Rural School. Even the school lockers and clothing has been Americanised. Also, Sorry to break some folks dreams but Military Academies are very US but very Un-UK. EDIT - One storyline using Statutory Rape as a theatrical device is plain silly. The term has no place in British  Law. There now will be a growing cadre of millions of confused UK kids believing it does.   However, the Aimee Lou Wood storyline is very well written and uses so many camera and directorial tricks to communicate fleeting reality to the audience. This also leaves screen peers with credible confusion and misunderstanding. It's well worth watching so as to be able to see and if appropriate learn the signs, signals and distress of a teen girl's PTSD linked to sexual assault.   That the storyline is embedded in an angst-ridden teen comedy with adult themes on sex makes it more credible and gives real and valid contrast with depth and reality."

So often, people with PTSD are tapped in environments, homes and locations which either fail to support them or even make the PTSD far worse, crippling them.  I'm tired of explaining to supposed professionals that for me being on a third floor and above makes my PTSD Better. Anything moving at high speed in my peripheral vision has me triggered. Small birds are the most common trigger as they flit past. But as they stay below a certain height to avoid predation, If I'm up in the air this trigger literally vanishes.    I'd also love to be able to emigrate to somewhere tropical. My PTSD is linked to Muscular Skeletal injury and chronic pain, and the only thing that gives me significant relief without side effects is high heat levels, generally in the high 20s centigrade (80 Fahrenheit) and preferably 35 centigrade plus (95+ Fahrenheit). In the UK winter I'm unable to afford the heating needed and end up trapped in one room with little option. It's insulting when yet again some supposed bright spark says ""Why not have a hot bath"" as if this bright idea is something people with PTSD could never come up with for themselves. I'd love to be living somewhere free from the patronising idiocy that seems to be at plague proportions and endemic amongst those without PTSD.     When I need an escape I often look for high rise accommodation in Tropical Zones. Panama City seems to be my best option.   Often the changes needed to improve your life are not rocket science, but often others control your access to them. One guy who was living in a ground floor flat was pestered by birds flitting past. When he sought permission from the Landlord to replant the garden with plants that were Bird UNFridendly to drive then away the landlord went ape shit and accused the guy of Bird Hating and killing mother nature. There are well-known practices in using certain plants that birds can't readily perch upon to get them to locate to other places.

journey1992,11,"Ugh, I am feeling so anxious and gross hearing from my abusive siblings and crossing my No Contact Boundary to ask my sister for a favor  I went no contact with my brother and sister (except they can email me for emergencies) 3 months ago because I know it is best for my healing journey. They have chosen what is most convenient for them even though they have acknowledged all the abuse that happened: sexual, emotional, scapegoating and triangulation. Both of my siblings chose my parents side ultimately and through me confronting my father for the sexual abuse, they had a history of scapegoating, victim blaming, and supporting me very little.  I’ve been much better being away from them. Unfortunately, my MDMA therapist decided he is longer providing psychedelic therapy. This really made me feel unstable and worried because I have been counting on the psychedelics to heal my PTSD sooner. I don’t have my connections or friendships at this time so I knew it would take awhile for me to find connections. So out of anxiety, against my intuition, I asked My sister if she could give me access to her psychedelic source. I felt guilt like I felt like this was being using but also rationalized this as an emergency and I would Help her out in an emergency as well. Luckily she said yes and I thanked her.. I am still waiting to hear back from her about the supply. I am worried she may change her mind. I also hate that I had to ask because she really is toxic to be my life now. I am thankful she helped me though, she didn’t have to do that. Our relationship is very complicated because growing up I was toxic and abusive to her. I’ve apologized to her, changed, and also feel this no contact boundary between us is so both of us can heal. So I also feel a lot of guilt for the past and at the same time, acknowledge that she is now being toxic in my life  (supporting my abusers, verbally abusive sometimes etc.) And is not safe to be in my life. I just want her to give the source’s number ASAP so I can go back to very limited contact/no contact again.  Then I received an email from my brother (who is suspect is a narcissist now due to all his abuse and neglect as a child). He said he missed me and was thinking about me. I definitely don’t want him in my life. I feel sadness and compassion for him because I know the abuse he endured.. but I see him for who he is which is a narcissistic who abuses his girlfriend, cares about social status, and not really caring for me if it is out of his convenience.  I for sure need to go no contact with him. I am thinking of either not responding or responding “thank you, I love and hope you are doing well, too. Please respect my boundary of only contacting for emergency.”  I’ve been feeling down and anxious. I definitely don’t want these individuals in my life. Having contact with them again feelings like I put salt on an open wound.   Anyone been my situation before? What would you do?"

Of course I am going to have a hard time with my sexuality and feel guilt/shame when I’ve endured sexual abuse my whole life. Of course focusing on my fashion and looks is not my priority as I mainly want to make sure I have enough money for shelter and food. I have been in survival for so long, it is going to take awhile for me to thrive. I must give myself compassion, forgiveness and patience.  However, I also wonder if there is a part of me that is self sabotaging my happiness by continuing the abuse my parents gave out. They grounded me and isolated me from others all the time. They rejected and neglected me, not giving me intimacy. They deprived me of pleasure like going shopping, getting my hair done, sleep, and love. I wonder if there is a part of me that is so used to that abuse and deprivation that he is trying to maintain some familiarity of what was “normal” for me in my past.  I frequently am checking in and asking, in this moment, can I push myself further out of my comfort zone (do) or just allow myself to rest and heal with patience (be)? Am I self sabotaging/punishing myself or listening to my needs/feelings to rest and take it slow?  Who else relates? How have you coped?"
journey1992,11,"Anyone tired of constantly second guessing whether your feelings towards others/situations are intuitive or a traumatic response?  It feels like I am gaslighting and second guessing myself frequently trying to figure out if I should trust my feelings and thoughts. I am frequently wondering if I should trust my feeling of feeling this person is unsafe due to intuition or is it my trauma/disorganized attachment talking. I started seeing a new therapist and when I first met her, I was like I trust her and think it’s a good fit. But the next time I saw her, I started protecting myself and closed up and felt hesitant to trust her. I told her it felt like she didn’t trust me and she hinted towards questioning whether my interpretations are accurate of her feelings. She said she wondered if I was projecting my feelings towards her at me but she also told me to trust my feelings and listen to my body. I told her I agreed. The issue is, do I trust my feelings of a person not being safe when I feel that way about most people?   Ahh, this is tough. I’ve been gaslit by whole life by narcs so I want to make sure i don’t gaslight myself. I want to trust my feelings and intuition.. but I also know my interpretations are not always accurate because I may see things a certain way due to  PTSD triggers. Often I’ll check the facts but I am very intuitive and the facts don’t always have the full answers.  Ahh, it’s exhausting. Anyone relate? How do you cope?"
journey1992,11,"I’ve realized my parents were torturing and trying to kill me  I feel so much sadness realizing my parents tortured me and tried to kill me. I was tortured, scapegoated, gaslighted, sexually abused, physically abused, deprived and neglected. They didn’t care how they were affecting me as long as their needs were being met. My dad was getting his sexual needs met through covertly sexually abusing me. My mom wanted me to suffer because she blamed me for the sexual abuse and was jealous. The only way I got my needs met was sexualizing myself to my dad.   Recently, I have been thinking about the punishments I was given by my parents. I received solitary confinement for many years where I was grounded and stuck in my room with no privileges. It makes me sick and so sad this happened to me. I’ve read about how terrible solitary confinement is for prisoners’ mental health and I empathize with them so much. No wonder I was mentally unstable with PTSD, poor social skills, and developmentally arrested (peed in my bed and played with barbies until I was 16). My dad used to criticize me saying I was so immature. Wow, it was because of him I was developmentally behind. He kept me in the house all of the time with the abuse with no outlet or friends.  It is very scary to witness a narcissist. They can keep hurting you without any care. They do not have empathy. They do not feel others’ pain.  I am so happy I finally saw reality for what it was and got out forever. Memories like this remind me why I could never go back to my abusers and the people who supported the abusers (siblings and relatives).   I will NOT be a scapegoat again. I will choose community that chooses me NOT tolerate and abuse me. I am proud of myself for working hard to remove the toxic people and messages from my life. I am so glad to be out of the fog. The hard part is done now I’ve just got to continue healing my PTSD and build new healthy relationships.  I’m processing all the pain of the punishments I went through, I’ve been hit with sadness and a feeling of revenge.  Anyone relate?"
journey1992,11," Any other Child Sexual Abuse survivors feel guilt and shame for when being sensual and sexual?  I (28/F) can express sexuality similar to Marilyn Monroe where she acts sexy and childlike at the same time. I think it is because I was abused as a child just like her where my child part of me is dissociated. Or I wonder if it’s mainly because of my ENFP/bubbly/flirty personality. For example, I’ve noticed when I really appreciate what someone says or am enjoying good food, without realizing it, I’ll make passionate and sensual body movements and sex noises while saying mmhm and mmm. I have begun to notice I’ll sometimes adjust my energy/flirting with a man in a way that appeals to him as a way of people pleasing in order to get what I want, feel safe, or to survive from their anger. I learned as a young girl how to change myself to appeal to my abusers in order to survive and get what I want. I still have a core belief inside that the only way a man is going to care about me or being nice is he finds me attractive or if I flatter him by flirting.  Now that I’m an adult, I still have this issue of “flirting on accident” when I’m with men. And then I close off and hide my personality because I get scared they might start liking me and that I’ll get abused. I feel shame like it was my fault I attracted men’s sexual attention. I have been sexualized my whole life and so then when I behave in a sexual way, I think it’s my fault for attracting sexual harassment.  Anyone else relate?"
journey1992,11,"I was the scapegoat of my family for my whole life before going no contact with my family this year.  I was chosen to be the scapegoat especially because my mom hated that my dad gave me attention and she punished me for his sexual abuse. I also think I was chosen because I was the strongest, least able to be manipulated, had integrity, honesty, assertiveness, justice seeking, and empathic. They thought I could take the abuse because I was so strong and resilient and would fight back for what I believed in.  Having that role for so long has definitely helped me become more authentic, compassionate, sensitive, self less and justice seeking. I question authority and status quo and instead do what I think is right /aligned with my values. I stand up for what I believe even if I am the only one doing it and it will make me unpopular. I am honest, genuine, and was courageous enough to go no contact with my family and never go back.   How about you all?  Who else was the scapegoat of their family? What strengths did you develop because of your role? Why do you think you were chosen for that role?"
journey1992,11,"Anyone’s rumination and intrusive thinking worse on CBD because it causes lack of motivation and discipline?!  I’ve been taking 15 mg full spectrum CBD oil capsules (with low THC) 1-2/day. I’ve noticed it calms my PTSD startle responses in public but it also makes me become more apathetic, unmotivated, and lazier. I notice I have less discipline to practice meditation and stop myself from ruminating and thinking of intrusive thoughts. My mind keeps resisting the CBD calmness and I keep ruminating non stop. This is my second day of migraines and I think it’s because of the nonstop ruminating. I think the CBD is making this worse. I also wonder if my mind is ruminating even more with cbd because it is not used to the calmness and is trying to cause mental distress to go back to that fight or flight State I am used to as a form of self sabotage (I keep thinking about distressing memories). I also notice CBD oil makes it harder for me to process my emotions as it has a numbing effect. Maybe I am taking too much?"

journey1992,11,"Anyone else realize their constant shortness of breath was a trauma response/anxiety not allergies?  I have allergies so in the past, I always thought when I was experiencing shortness of breath because of allergy induced asthma. I also am anemic so I know that can cause shortness of breath. These are definitely reasons I have difficulty breathing sometimes, however, I’ve begun to realize how much trauma has played a role in the breathing.  Recently, I’ve been more mindful of my breath and I noticed it changes through out the day. If I am triggered (which is constantly), I will often hold in my breath or start having shortness of breath/ difficulty breathing. If I try to calm myself down with meditation and deep breaths, my breathing can become easier. When I take cbd oil, I notice my breathing becomes easier because it turns down my fight or flight response that leads to shortness of breath. After sleeping, I notice my breath is better as well. So really a lot of this shortness of breath was due to trauma. I even got tested for sleep apnea recently because I noticed the difficulty of breathing and how I would stop breathing but I didn’t have sleep apnea.  Wow! So now I am really going to try to focus on my breathing and pursue Breath Work.  Anyone relate?"
journey1992,11,"CBD or Marijuana for PTSD?  Hello,  I am CPTSD and really need help with regulating my emotions, sleep, eating, and staying present. What is best for PTSD in your opinion: CBD or marijuana?"
journey1992,11,"Need support: I’m nervous/excited for upcoming MDMA session for CPTSD  In 2 weeks, I will have my first MDMA assisted therapy session and I cannot wait. I am soooo impatient and just want these next two weeks to speed up! I am afraid Something bad will happen or I’ll die before the session... I just want to do it already! Years of therapy, dbt, and some EMDR have no doubt helped me as I have healed so much. But I still have the PTSD, isolation, fear of attachment (disorganized attachment), and fear of sexuality (child sexual abuse survivor).. In my gut, I really believe MDMA is going to help me so much. The studies on Its effects on PTSD survivors is very promising. I just wanna be open and love others more freely again. I want to love more and be less judgmental of myself and others. I want to move on from my trauma and the negative core beliefs I have about myself. I want to start thriving and living instead of surviving. I want to have fun again. I have so much hope for MDMA but I’m also am kinda scared I’m putting my expectations too high on what it will do for my PTSD. I am very hopeful it will help a lot but I have to remind myself to be open to whatever comes on my MDMA journey.   Any tips or supportive words you all have for me if you have experience with MDMA? Thank you :))"
journey1992,11,"DAE have digestive issues like Candida, SIBO and/or Parasites?  I have reoccurring digestive issues such as Candida, SIBO and parasites even though I eat really clean and take the right supplements. I am convinced my body and immune system have become weakened and vulnerable to these conditions due to being under stress. The stress of being abused for so long leading to CPTSD can really put a toll on our body. I think my feeling of being stuck in my trauma manifests in my body where my digestion, parasites, and bad bacteria become stuck in my body. I believe as I continue healing from the trauma and release, my digestive issues will also go away. I live a lot of my days tense and hypervigilant. Anyone else struggle with similar GI issues?"
journey1992,11," Anyone else find sex to be dirty/shameful and have no sex drive?  I am in my late 20s and a female virgin. I was sexualized starting as a child. I experienced covert sexual abuse and emotional incest until my early 20’s. I was assaulted at 18 which made me scared to have sex or get a pelvic exam. Instead of having sex like most teenagers, I thought sex was gross and was scared of the pain of sex. While In college, I was very flirty and hypersexual and attempted to have sex many times but was too scared to.  Now I am less scared of sex and have been able to do a pelvic exam as long as I put the device inside. However, I am not dating now and I know I can’t have sex unless I am intimate with someone which is very hard for me to do due to my disorganized attachment style. Also, when I would kiss guys in college and do other stuff (not sex), I often felt shameful and dirty after. I think it’s because I was sexually abused growing up and also was taught by my parents that sex/sexuality was wrong and slutty. I also think vaginas are gross and don’t like the way mine looks and worry about being judged. Also, once I recently came to the realization my dad covertly sexually abused, I now have no sex drive. I used to be attracted to aggressive and abusive sex/sexuality where men did not take no for an answer. Through therapy, I realized I was traumatically bonded and once’s I processed my trauma history and see where this attraction was coming from, I am no longer drawn to that type of sexuality. Now I have no sex drive at all and cannot let myself orgasm or see myself do anything sexual. I am concerned!     I will be doing MDMA assisted therapy soon and I really hope that helps.   Anyone else struggle with feeling shame and dirty after being sexual? Anyone else have no sex drive? Any tips?"
journey1992,11,"Anyone else burnt out and not ready to invest in relationships?  I know community and social support is healing and important. However, I am accepting I am not ready to fully invest in relationships as I am working hard on my self healing and my relationship with myself. I can’t really fully give in a relationship right now which isn’t fair to the other person. That also means I cannot be the social justice, nurturing, helper, enfp/infp woman I am in my heart. I have to use those skills on healing myself now. It was hard for me to quit my social service job to work in a job I barely help others and that I have no passion for. Thankfully, it is such a low stress job that I am able to focus on my healing. Taking this time to focus on my self care is not selfish. I need this time. I can’t give what I don’t have. I am burnt out by people. I am irritated by people. I fear people. I need this time to heal myself and then my relationships with others. I have learned what a healthy relationships with boundaries looks like. Now I am super cautious who I let into my life as I am watchful of red flags and am aware of the toxic people I tend to attract due to traumatic bonding. I am also aware of the toxic behaviors I am healing and working on so I have to be very mindful of how I am with others, too. It is exhausting and it feels good to have a lot of alone time.  Anyone else relate?"
